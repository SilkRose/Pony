# Friendship is Markdown

FiM is a simple Markdown editor for the terminal.

## Ideas:
- For headers, in the terminal you can't really make them bigger like a normal editor, but I thought about setting colors for each heading level and being able to use the background color like a progress bar, that shows what heading level it is.
- When the cursor is on a line, it shows the Markdown syntax; otherwise it's hidden.
- Being able to set custom colors for everything, like markdown syntax, bold text, italics, etc.
- Text expansion, so you can make it expand to Twilight Sparkle by typing ts (space).
- Custom left and right padding, so the content is centered and not stretched over the whole screen.
- Being able to set it, so the active line is brighter, and the rest is dimmer, for focus.
- Being able to set the char to use for the line break.
