## Reader’s Standpoint  
There’s not much happening in these 1000 words, and that's not necessarily a bad thing.

- It was a quick, pleasant read. 
- The dialogue was written well and in a convincing manner.
- The tiny exposition at the beginning sets the scene quite well.
- While I do feel it felt a bit quick, considering it’s Fluttershy, the pacing was also done quite well.

The Reader’s experience was Pretty Good.

## Writer’s Standpoint
- Using one lines can be interesting to read in a longer story, however, the way it was utilized in this one shot, 1000-word story, it made the story feel just a slight bit longer.
- Having two characters talking constantly throughout the fic, makes writing dialogue a lot easier. It also allows for a greater use of other description, focusing on the delivery of the line instead of constantly indicating who had talked. The author did great with indicating who was talking. It certainly helps with Fluttershy narrating in the first person.

The Writer’s experience was Pretty Good.

## What Works
- A quick, heartwarming story that requires no exposition nor explanation.
- great plot twist

## What Doesn’t Work  
I don't have anything of important to note. 

## Concluding Thoughts  
I thought the story was great. Simple and awesome, straight to the point. It’s so typical Silk Rose, and there’s nothing wrong with that! While I do have some reservations with Pinkie being so quick on the uptake, it just feels weird from a romance standpoint, as, typically, it takes time to formulate an answer or even to just form thoughts in general, but it makes sense, given her character.   
Also, the decision to use Equestria Girls instead of Silk Rose’s standard of Equestria was a good idea with this particular story. Fingers and hands have their unique qualities, don’t they?

**In conclusion,** I think this is a quaint little story that expresses shipping at its wholesome finest.
