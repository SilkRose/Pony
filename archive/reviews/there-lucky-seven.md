## Introduction

_There_ is a story written by Silk Rose with a rather simple premise: Rarity is dead, and Rainbow Dash is having trouble moving on. At its core, this doesn't sound very original, but I think where this story really shines is in the lack of dialogue (until the very end). Speaking as someone who recently lost a beloved pet of mine, you never truly know what it feels like to be alone until you lose someone you lived with. The emotional weight is sometimes too much to bear as we can't help but find ourselves calling out to our lost ones in the misplaced hope that they may offer a response.

What I'm trying to convey, and what this story conveys exceedingly well, is that grief is **difficult**. Let's dive in.

## Plot

So as stated in the introduction, I don't think the idea itself is anything too original. There's been plenty of stories like it on Fimfic. Heck, I've written some as well because it's a tried and true formula designed to tug at the heartstrings. But in order for it to do so, you have to have an understanding of grief. A lot of authors fall into the trap of writing only about sad things for the entirety of the story. This is because, as a mechanism, grief is often very misunderstood. I'll explain.

Grief is a necessity. It is something humans _need_. It's a good thing. The reason we feel grief is because of loss, and the reason that loss hits hard is because what we lost was something that took up a large portion of our heart. When you lose something like that, the void is immense. Grief is our brain's way of coping with that loss.

In this story, Rainbow Dash is firmly planted in the first stage of grief: **Denial**.

The hook to start off the story is pretty good, because it's a feeling a lot of us have been through. The hope that when we open our eyes, things will have returned to normal. But still, we're scared to do so because we understand deep down that that hope is misplaced. The entirety of this story is Rainbow Dash not wanting to open her eyes because she's afraid to face yet another day without her beloved Rarity. A simple concept but elevated to the next level through, as we've built up to, Silk Rose's understanding of grief. Rainbow Dash spends the majority of this story with memories of her relationship with Rarity flying through her head.

One of them in particular really stood out to me:

> I've sat at her makeup desk and stared at myself in the mirror so many times, imagining all the ways she used to dress me up and do my makeup. I used to give her a hard time, but I loved it so much. How much would I give to just do it once more with her? To do anything once more with her?

Beautiful, truly. We don't realize how much we miss those little things until they're snatched away from us. Taking everything into account, the story pokes at your emotions exactly how the author was hoping, and handles grief in a way that tells me the author has likely been through something similar in their life. Still, it hasn't eluded me that the idea for the story itself isn't the most original thing out there. But the pacing is excellent for a story clocking in at exactly one thousand words, and Silk Rose does a good job at getting you hooked.

Plot Score: 8/10

## Characterization

The only character that we get a true taste of in this story is Rainbow Dash. Is she well-defined and written in a way that feels true to her canon self?

I would say yes. Rainbow Dash at her core is a character that struggled with self-doubt and puts on a front to hide that fault. Because of this, I've always felt she is misunderstood by a large portion of the fandom. Masking our faults is a very natural thing that we all do; nobody likes it when other people can easily see their weaknesses. The downside of us doing this is that when tragedy strikes, our true self is ripped out through that hole in our heart and shown off to the world. Silk Rose understood that, and Rainbow Dash is swirling with negative emotions and she has to come to terms with the fact that she's no longer the cool, composed pony.

Characterization Score: 5/5

## Spelling, Grammar, & Syntax

Overall, I struggled to find any real errors in this story aside from a change of tense in the second to last line, where it changes from present to past-tense mid-sentence.

> "I love you, Rarity," I say as the tears started to fall.

Should be:

> "I love you, Rarity," I say as the tears start to fall.

Given that this error occurred right at the end of an emotionally driven story, it did take me out of it just a tiny bit.

SGS Score: 4/5

## Personal Enjoyment

So, did I enjoy the story?

Heck yeah I did.

As I stated at the start of the review, I just recently went through the loss of someone close to me, my beloved dog. The grief I've been feeling since that day has been immense, and reading stories like this helps me put my loss into perspective. I'm not the only one going through this struggle, and the grief I'm feeling is a result of many years of happiness and love. That's where this review comes full circle. Silk Rose has a great understanding of the fact that, at its core, grief happens _because_ we were so happy. We're not sad just because. We're sad because we lost something that provided us with the opposite emotion on a constant basis.

Speaking of things that provided me with happiness…

Personal Enjoyment Score: 5/5

Total Score Average: 4.4/5

I would definitely recommend reading this story if you're into the sad genre. It's my wheelhouse, so this provided a familiar comfort to me as I read, but your mileage may vary, especially if you've recently gone through loss yourself. That being said, this was a pleasure to read and review.

Thank you for writing this, Silk Rose!
