Silk:  
You have a solid portfolio and there's nothing here that is going to change that.

Due to the length and overall story complexity, this will be a relatively short review. If you have specific questions I'd be happy to go further into these answers.

The World:  
As this takes place entirely in the space of one bed and there is no external information provided. I'm going to assume this is standard EQ timeline. However, there was a space at the beginning to give some amount of world building throughout, such as the room, the smell, or the feel of the surroundings. Otherwise, no additional notes.

The Characters:  
Appears to be show standard, sans character inclination. Although the core implication is that they want to date, from a functional standpoint it could have also been served by a closer friendship.

A heist is the kind of thing pinkie would absolutely do, but the lack of a costume could be counted against the characterization.

Spelling and Grammar:  
No notes.

Flow:  
The flow in this is similar to a type of writing style I myself use, however the lack of additional details and "feelings" leaves something to be desired. That being said, I always enjoy the usage of "Inner monologue" as an explanation of a character's motivation. I'd just like to see more tying of it to physical sensations or stimulation.

Personal Opinions:  
Overall, It's an effective story for the length and complexity of its content. As for further personal opinions, they got rolled into the flow section of this review.

So that's it then, as I said if you have specific questions, I'm happy to provide more specific examples.
