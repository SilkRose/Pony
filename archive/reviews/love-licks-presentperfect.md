_Pinkie Pie presents Twilight with a unique intellectual challenge._  
This is equal parts cute, silly, and damnably clever. The one thing against it: I kind of thought this mixture of silliness and intellectualism would be emblematic of an already established TwiPie relationship. It'd be the kind of thing that shows why they work so well together, not how they get together! I ultimately consider this a minor issue, though; this is just sort of worth it on its own merits. But, damn, the Ponk do be bold!
