# Letters from a Hat

Rainbow Dash, Rarity, and Applejack were in Rarity's kitchen having a discussion on an upcoming peace treaty with the changelings.

"I just think we should put our best hoof forward, and a fashion show would do great," Rarity said.

"We should try to impress them with a Wonderbolt's show. That would give them a great impression of us," Rainbow suggested.

"What we should do is hold a rodeo, show them a really good time," Applejack said.

"We want to show them our best, our most artistic and regal showing," Rarity said.

"A Wonderbolt's show is our best. Equestria's top flyers doing a highly choreographed and synchronized aerial show," Rainbow replied.

"A rodeo would be our best, some of the best rodeo ponies around Equestria would show up," Applejack said.

"We can't do all three, we barely have enough time to do one," Rarity added.

"The Wonderbolt's probably already have a show ready that we can do," Rainbow said.

"I got some favors I could call in, we could get a rodeo setup in no time," Applejack said.

"I already have a new dress line I could show off, it would help my business a lot," Rarity offered.

Twilight trotted into the kitchen. "What's going on in here?"

"We are just discussing what would be best to do for the changeling visit. I suggested a fashion show, but these two have their own ideas," Rarity answered.

"A Wonderbolt's show is the best idea," Rainbow said.

"A rodeo is a way better idea," Applejack said.

Twilight suggested, "What if you all compromised?"

"A fashion show starring the Wonderbolt's could work, but would never work with a rodeo theme too," Rarity answered.

"A Wonderbolt's show wouldn't work with them wearing fancy dresses, but they could participate in a rodeo maybe," Rainbow said.

"A rodeo wouldn't be much of a rodeo with a bunch of ponies who've never done it before. Although I guess the participants could wear some fancy uniforms," Applejack said.



The three ponies' argument only intensified when they started name-calling, clearly taking this way too seriously.

Twilight just sighed as she stared at three of the ponies that will be with her for the rest of her life.

Twilight just watched them bicker back and forth as she collected herself. A few moments later, she shouted, "Stop!"

After everypony stopped their arguing, Twilight suggested, "Why don't we do a friendship building exercise, doesn't that sound fun?"

Rarity nodded.

Rainbow Dash shrugged.

Applejack shook her head.

"It'll be fun, I promise!" Twilight said before taking Applejack's hat in her magic.

Twilight gave them each a slip of paper and a pencil. "Write your name down and put it in the hat. Trust me, this game will be fun."

Before anypony could put their paper in the hat, Pinkie popped out of said hat, and startled Twilight.

"Ah," Twilight shouted, not expecting Pinkie's presence.

Pinkie was unfazed by Twilight's reaction. "Hi Twilight, Applejack, Rarity, and Rainbow! Did somepony say game? I love games."

Twilight recovered, and explained, "Yes, we are doing a friendship exercise, and I was just about to explain how it works."

She gave Pinkie a piece of paper and a pencil. "We are going to draw names from the hat and write them a letter, then we will also write a reply letter to the pony who sent you a letter."

Pinkie raised her hoof almost immediately.

"Yes Pinkie?" Twilight asked.

"Can I add a few more ponies to the hat? Don't want to exclude anypony from this fun activity."

"Sounds like a good idea, sure."

"Yay!"

Pinkie put her slip of paper in before writing a few more and adding them.

Twilight looked at the group of ponies assembled around her. "These are not required, but some good ideas for you to include in your letters are: reveal something about yourself, ask them a question, preferably about friendship, and give them a compliment."

Twilight received various nods and agreements of understanding.

She asked, "Okay, who wants to go first?"

Pinkie spoke up immediately, "Oh! Me! Me!"
