## Synopsis:
A stallion falls for his mailmare, inspired by [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDc9WaQHP1g) song.

## Description:


## Short Description:


## Ideas:
- Protagonist is a earth pony, dusty blond mane, worn leather colored coat.

## Chapters:
[Day 1](./01.md) Saturday - he notices her:
 - He moves in, came from a big city, takes in the surroundings. thinks about how much nicer and quieter it is here, like the small village he grew up in.
 - mail comes, sees Derpy, briefly interacts. (she greets him.)
 - takes mail in as he takes his shit in and starts unpacking as he briefly thinks about how friendly the mail mare was.
 - As he unpacks, it strikes him how roomy the home is compared to how it looks from the outside, but also empty(as an afterthought he barely notices?)
 - As he situates his shit throughout the house, he reminisces on memories some of his belongings bring up.

[Day 2](./02.md) sun time gap:
 - Can't get a certain mare out of his mind
 - Goes about his morning routine, remembers its mail day, goes out to get it.
 - Interacts with Derpy again (she asks how he likes it here?)
 - Goes into the house with mail, as he goes through it, the last thing he finds is an advertisement for hearts n hooves day, which brings derpy into the forefront of his mind more than before, after which, he realizes just why he can't get her out of his mind.
 - Goes on another walk (looking for work?), thinks about her

[Day 3](./03.md) (Monday?):
 - Gets mail reminding him of hearts and hooves day coming up.
 - Realization hits
 - The more he thinks about it, the more he gets pulled in.
 - However, the more he thinks about it, the more he also thinks about how little he knows of her, and how briefly he even knew she existed.
 - Because of that, he thinks it's just her looks that have him hooked, but when he reminds himself that he barely knows her, her demeanor and their brief chats come to mind. 
 - Which brings him to the fact that he hasn't known about her long, but then comes how open and genuine her persona seems to be. 
 - He thinks about how silly it is that he thinks he knows her that well with how little he's actually interacted, but in the middle of that, intrusive thoughts about her quirks jump in and distract him from that, followed by all the other thoughts that came as he told himself that it was probably just her looks.
 - Which gradually disrupts his ability to continue to reason that it isn't very likely that he got a good reading of her personality in the short time he's known her.

[Day 4](./04.md) Tuesday:
- Tries to dismiss it as nothing more than liking the way she looks, but the more he does so, the more characteristics like her persona, demeanor, and quirks force themselves into mind.

[Day 5](./05.md) Wednesday:
 - Like day 3, but trying to convince himself not to act on it. the way he feels about derpy is more or less exactly how he felt about someone in the past, but(the relationship went to shit?) (he ruined the relationship?) (he got rejected and it was his first time asking anyone out?)

[Day 6](./06.md) Thursday:
 - Realizes that if he continues to not act on feelings like this, he'll be alone for quite a while, maybe the rest of his life living in regret. going off that, he persuades himself to suck it up, and do something about it.
 - wakes up, reflecting on how empty the other side of his bed is (or some shit like that)
 - thinks about all the mares he could have talked to, but didn't have the guts to actually do it as he drags himself through his morning routine
 - entire time notes how empty the house is.
 - goes on a walk to try and clear his head, instead sees couples left and right, driving his feelings of loneliness even further home
 - turns tail and goes back home, reflecting on how he didn't talk to any of the mares before, and the regret of each instance
 - reflects that this will only continue unless he grows a spine and does something about his feelings.
 - makes up his damn mind, starts thinking about how to go about getting his feelings across without coming off the wrong way.

[Day 7](./07.md) Friday:
 - writes letter writes, rewrites over and over
 - writes letter, rewrites letter

[Day 8](./08.md) Saturday:
 - he asks her out. Almost doesn't go through with it, but finally has a moment where he says screw it, dashes out to the mailbox and back quickly. then pacing back n forth, second guessing the decision, eventually reaching the conclusion to take the letter back and pretending it never happened, but its already been taken.
 - finally finishes the letter. (pulled an all-nighter?)
 - looks it over, making sure it sounds right
 - paces around thinking about how things might play out
 - mostly comes up with scenarios with things turning out bad, a few where it works out but almost mockingly stupid
 - kinda deadpans for a moment, says "screw it" walks out and puts the letter in before he starts thinking again
 - goes on yet another walk to distract himself from what he just did
 - fails miserably, makes a mad dash back to the house to get the letter back, eat it(literally) and pretend it never happened.
 - turns out Derpy already collected the letter, deadpans.
 - calmly walks inside, gradually starts getting more and more anxious, falls asleep without noticing

[Day 9](./09.md) Sunday:
- anxious hell
- joke shop
- library
- run in with twilight?
- have spike make a fool of himself?

[Day 10](./10.md) Monday:
 - no mail on holiday (H&H day) Derpy delivers her response  in person on her own time, makes him open it in front of her. he thinks it's mail day in his anxious delirium, he thinks it's mail day. he expresses concern about her other deliveries, she says something along the lines of "nope" or "I've got all the time i need" affectionately.
