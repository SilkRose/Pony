Creative Freedom is out! I hope you enjoyed it.

This one was personal to me. Being creative can be hard, and dealing with unmatched expectations can really drain your motivation.

I'm excited to start on my next story, it should be for one of the 100 followers giveaway winners. I also plan to release a few blog posts in between about a couple of topics I'd love to discuss.

Stay safe.
