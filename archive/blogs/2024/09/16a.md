I've always wanted to make a comedy out of a speed dating event, and this was it. I like how it turned out. This was my first story that is both romance and comedy. And I really like the ending with Applejack just telling the others to kiss while politely asking out Twilight.

My next story will be coming out on the 22nd! And hopefully the one after that will release on the 29th! I'm excited for both of these stories. They're both romance and one of them is Equestria Girls.

FIMFiction has implemented a new system for blocking bots from the site. This had affected my auto-updating bio story recommendations. Luckily, I was able to update the code to work around this new block.

See you Sunday!
