This was my first published Equestria Girls story, but it wasn't the first one I've written. That story will hopefully be coming out soon.

This story was originally for the [Dialogue only contest!](https://www.fimfiction.net/blog/1038499/dialogue-only-contest), but I was unable to write it in time. Luckily, I was able to enter it into [The Rainbow Rocks 10th Anniversary Shipping Contest](https://www.fimfiction.net/group/216924/the-eqg-anniversary-contests-spring-fling/thread/539825/the-rainbow-rocks-10th-anniversary-shipping-contest-may-26-august-3-the-rules-and-how-to-enter), where it won a [Judge Prize](https://www.fimfiction.net/group/216924/the-eqg-anniversary-contests-spring-fling/thread/546412/the-rainbow-rocks-shipping-contest-results). Also, the story got a [review](https://www.fimfiction.net/group/217953/harmony-reviews/thread/544653/vis-reviews-whispers-and-wishes-silk-rose) by [Visharo](https://www.fimfiction.net/user/449252/Visharo).

Now for my thoughts on the story. I really liked writing it, it was fun. I think it turned out super cute. I also, really liked the ending with all of them saying goodnight.

I definitely plan on writing more Equestria Girls stories, especially romance ones.

Until next time.
