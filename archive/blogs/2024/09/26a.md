# Love, Life, and Lamination

During the last five days, I've written over six-hundred lines of Rust code on a back-end API for a side-project of [PseudoBob Delightus](https://www.fimfiction.net/user/12771/PseudoBob+Delightus). At the moment this project isn't public, so I can't say what it is, but it is related to FIMFiction and stories. ðŸ‘€

I was surprised at how well this story did. It was originally made for [A Thousand Words Contest III](https://www.fimfiction.net/group/216361/a-thousand-words/thread/540659/a-thousand-words-contest-iii-2024-jun-09-jul-14), but I was unable to write part of it and ended up asking [Scriblits Talo](https://www.fimfiction.net/user/495925/Scriblits+Talo/stories) for help. I think he did a great job, and I enjoyed how the story turned out.

The idea for the story was originally going to be about loss, the first title was, "Love, Loss, and Lamination." It was going to be about a pony dying and the friend/spouse having trouble laminating the death certificate.

But after talking with PseudoBob and Scriblits, I decided to change it. Scriblits really helped with the ideas, which was nice. PseudoBob gave me feedback on the cover, and was the one who suggested using their hoofprints on the marriage certificate.

I'm still planning on releasing my next story on the 29th. Wish me luck, I'm going to need it. I've got over 1000 words done on it, but I kinda want to rewrite it.

Thanks for reading!
