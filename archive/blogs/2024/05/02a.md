I knew exactly what the tone was going to be when I thought of the name. I liked this one a lot. I think it did pretty well for not getting featured.

Both stories for May are written and just need proofread. I'm very excited for both of them!

I'd like to also give a shout-out to [PseudoBob Delightus](https://www.fimfiction.net/user/12771/PseudoBob+Delightus), I pre-read his two latest stories: [The Holes In My Head](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/555824/the-holes-in-my-head), and [The Pink I Live In](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/554715/the-pink-i-live-in). You should go check them out if you like horror!

Stay safe!
