# More Readings and Some Questions

I'm going to start with the new readings:

Profound Ponytail now with a second [reading](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKw3kauBSqM) done by [Lotus Moon](https://www.youtube.com/@LotusMoon).

There now with a [reading](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ntgub22ZFcU) done by [Rainbow Infinity Readings](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_iFUISpI08ALO1DiwFbWHw).

Now, for a general update.

Things are going good, made some writing progress, but now I'm ramping it up. With the 1000-word contest, I'm going to try to enter for each category. I'm still going to try to get two stories out this month.

I wanted to ask some question to the people who read my stories:
1. What do you want to read from me? Like genre or style.
2. Do you want me to do another story giveaway for 150 followers like I did at 100.
3. Does anyone have any feedback on my writing?
4. How's your day going?

I know in general I like to write romance, comedy, horror, and slice of life. But, I do want to write in every genre. I have a few romance and slice of life stories in the works, hopefully you'll see them soon.

I'd be more than okay doing another story giveaway, but only if it's something people want.

I want to do my best to improve, so any feedback or advice is appreciated.

And, my days going good.

Thanks for reading! *Hug.*
