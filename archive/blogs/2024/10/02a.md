My next story is probably going to be another romance, I've started on it, and I'm about 15% done. I've also got a 13 author collaboration that I recently got back on track after a few months delay. 

I'm going to try to release two stories this month, I feel like I can do that. I'm trying to finish stories that I haven't written but have covers. This story was one of them, I had the cover done for over a year before I finally wrote it.

I wrote this story in one day. I think it turned out cute. I need to stop waiting till the last minute to write stories. Thankfully, this month I've already started writing, and I'm going to try to get the stories done early.

Have a great day!
