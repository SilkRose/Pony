# New Translation, Readings, and Auto-Updating Bio

As you might have noticed, my bio on my profile has started changing each day. This is because I've written code to automatically recommend other author's stories. The stories are not ones I have picked, but the author themselves. I simply asked for their most proud work and their best pony.

I have wanted to do this for a long time, to try to promote others where I can. I hope you give their stories a read!

I've found a new translation of my work! [The Pink Tax](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/539422/the-pink-tax) has a translation into Simplified Chinese. It's readable [here](https://fimtale.com/t/54575), and was translated by [keezwus](https://fimtale.com/u/keezwus).

Also, two new readings have been done of my stories. [Lotus Moon](https://www.youtube.com/@LotusMoon) has done a [reading](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hP5idtWADfk) of [Love Licks](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/540399/love-licks). And [Rainbow Infinity Readings](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_iFUISpI08ALO1DiwFbWHw) has done a [reading](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDpCsRCrsdM) of [Profound Ponytail](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/551751/profound-ponytail).

Don't think I've forgotten about April Fools, I've been working hard, coding what [PseudoBob Delightus](https://www.fimfiction.net/user/12771/PseudoBob+Delightus) and myself will need for it. I hope you are excited about it!

Thanks for reading, and stay safe!
