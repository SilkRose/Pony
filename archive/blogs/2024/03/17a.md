I had fun writing this story, a nice refresher after Cardboard Casket.  
The plush in the cover is mine, I've had her since 2013.  
And yes, I do strap her in a seatbelt when she comes with me.

I have several stories in the works, and I'm doing a collaborative story with PseudoBob Delightus for April Fools, so stay tuned for that!

Thanks for reading, and stay safe!
