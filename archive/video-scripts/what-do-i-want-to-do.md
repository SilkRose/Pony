"What do I actually want to do?"

Introduction:

I don't know what to do, like at all. What I mean is I have this desire to create, but I cannot decide what to I want to make, I have many interests, but I cannot decide what interest I want to create for.

This is a long video, throughout the process of writing it, I have realized a lot about me. Writing this has helped me a lot and I hope it can help you as well to spot problems in your own life and give you ideas and solutions to fix them.

Before we start, I want to give a tip to anyone that doesn't know where to start, write it down. Whatever your problems are, write them down, acknowledge them and write out a plan on how you are going to overcome them.

Section one: Change, and how to accept it.

I have a problem, at any given time, I don't know what to do. Paralyzed by the choice of which hobby I can or want to do. Most of the time when this happens, I pick the easy road, none. This leads to months of no progress, where I do nothing and feel like a failure. This is unhealthy, and I need to fix this.

This is going to be hard, but not impossible. I've known about this problem for over a year, but that's the thing, I've known for so long but haven't changed. You see, change is scary, change is different, change is hard. I know very well I don't like change, as an example, I listen to the same music for months or years and don't try to find new stuff to listen to. Often, new music has to be pushed on me for me to listen to it. So, knowing this, how am I going to achieve the change I need to make to be more productive? Well, this video is step one.

In order to accept change, you must first have an open mind. I have an open mind, at least when it comes to some things. The problem is this openness only applies to certain aspects of my life, how do I apply it to changing how I think about doing hobbies?

The answer, self-control. If you have a lot of self-control, you may be able to force yourself to try new things and make changes in your life and stick to them.

You need to be able to realize what aspects of your life are walled in and break down those walls. In order to break down these walls, we must first understand what can build them up.

Safety, a lot of the time we build walls to protect ourselves and feel safe, maybe when you tried something new it ended up going badly, so you build a wall and associate new things with bad outcomes.

Positive reinforcement, when you do something more than once, and it leads to the same outcome, it leads to you more strongly correlating new stuff to bad outcomes, thus building that wall higher.

Familiarity and comfort, we like what we know, and what we like is comfortable to us. This leads to you not wanting to try anything new, as you already have stuff you like.

Now there are more reasons people build walls, but for now these are all I'm going to cover.

How are we going to bring those walls down? The first step is acknowledging they are there, think to yourself when have I been unwilling to change and why?

Section two: Passion, and how to find it.

I don't know what I'm passionate about*. Now, that's not to say I don't have passions, I am very passionate about a lot, a few examples would be, My Little Pony, and computers. I love MLP and anything computer related. What I mean is, what am I passionate about creating? I, like many others, have a passion to create, we just don't know what we want to make.

In this section I want to go over the efforts I've made to find my passion, everything I've tried, why I wasn't passionate about them and how to help find your passion.

My biggest mistake when trying to find my passion, trying to do everything all at once. Doing more than one thing at a time isn't a good idea if you can avoid it, splitting your time means you can't dedicate the time and focus to each task to truly engross yourself in the hobby. This leads to premature dissatisfaction and a lack of willingness to continue. I beg of you, when trying to do new things, don't give up too soon and give them your proper time and attention.

My second-biggest mistake when trying to find my passion, having expectations. I understand as a creator you want your work to be seen and praised, but having unrealistic expectations or even realistic expectations at the start will crush your desire to make more. You need to create for yourself before anyone else, so that way if it doesn't get the attention you wanted, you're still happy with what you've made.

Another mistake I make is overdoing it. I would do the hobby too much and get burnt out, leading to me to go months in-between doing the hobby. It's important to give the hobby some time to know if you actually like it or not, but don't give it too much where it leads to burn out, or demotivation.

Another mistake I've made is limiting what I can do. Don't say this or that part of the hobby isn't for you, give it a try before dismissing each section. Also, just because you're 'bad' at this or that doesn't mean it's not for you, practice is how you get better.

The last mistake I'll mention is giving up when it's hard. It's going to be hard at first, almost everything is. You need to power through it and see if you truly like it or not. Along the same note as the previous one, just because a section of the hobby is hard doesn't mean it's not for you, like the hobby in general, practice makes perfect.

Now I'm going to go over all the creative endeavors I've done and explain why I am not passionate about each one and how I failed to engage with them appropriately.

Love & Tolerance resource pack -

The Love & Tolerance resource pack is a Minecraft resource pack themed around My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic. This resource pack combines my two favorite things, MLP and Minecraft. It was created over 10 years ago by a fellow named Arekuzu, then it was taken over by Hazzat, then it was maintained by Bronydog, then SolisLink, then me.

Over 3 year ago, I got tired of playing old versions of Minecraft because this resource pack wasn't up-to-date to the latest version of Minecraft. So I decided to start making textures, I joined the discord of MineLP, a Minecraft mod that turns the player and mobs into ponies. I found the people maintaining L&T, saw that they weren't that active, and started making textures. Eventually, over time, I ended up being seen as the project lead, I made a Discord for the pack and had the GitHub repo transferred to me. That's still how it is today.

Now, this might sound like something I'm passionate about, and that's because it is, I lied earlier. I can explain.

I am very passionate about L&T sometimes, you see, passions can come and go, and be linked to other interests. My passion for L&T is directly linked to my current interest in Minecraft. When I want to play Minecraft or a new update is about to come out, I am super passionate about L&T, and in return I make textures for it while I'm passionate.

But there is a problem with this, when I'm passionate about L&T, I tend to make a lot of textures and get burnt out. This burnout can last a month to half a year. I have realized this and am actively not doing too much now when I'm making textures.

I do however have more problems when it comes to L&T, I see the pack as a collaborative effort, over 25 people have worked on it, but a lot of the time I am the only one who is willing or can work on it. It's really demotivating to be the only person on a team working on a project. For me, this is something I still struggle with, I want help with making textures and other people either can't or can't be arsed.

Another problem I've faced when it comes to the pack, obsessing over numbers. I would constantly look at the numbers of downloads the pack had on GitHub or how many people were in the discord, this is a terrible mindset to be in. Yes, it's fine to look at numbers, but don't let them define you or your interest in a hobby. Do it for yourself first and foremost. This is something I still am trying to not do, but it's hard, as I write this I am constantly checking the word count of the script for this video.

The last problem I have with the pack is self-inflicted, I went ahead and made two Minecraft servers under the L&T name. For the past one and a half years, I have been running with the help of the other admin in the L&T discord, two Minecraft servers, one for survival and one for creative. For the most part it has been alright, but when the servers require attention it can take away from making textures.

Even with these problems, I don't see myself ever stopping work on the pack, heck I have the website domain registered till 2030, maybe by then the pack will actually be completed.

Writing fiction -

Writing fan fiction is the hobby I've done the longest, I released my first story on November 6th 2017. Since then, I have released four more stories, one incomplete, and three completed stories. Out of the stories I have released, three of them are romance, and one is _random_.

I love to write, I do however have issues I need to deal with.	

So that I'm not repeating myself, when I am having the same problem in more than one hobby, I am just going to mention that I have that issue in the specific hobby too and refer back to the previous instance. I am going to start with those.

"Don't hold yourself accountable to your unfinished work" don't think I should be working on this because it's unfinished. If you're not passionate for it at the time, don't force it.

"Relying on grammar tools" you shouldn't need a grammar tool if you're writing in your native language, learn your language. Grammar tools distract you from writing, if you must use one, turn it off until you are completely done writing.

Section three: Creativity, and how to express it.

Section four: Choice paralysis, and how to deal with it.
