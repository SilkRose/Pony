A collection of stories, ideas, names, and more, all pony related.

## About:

### Who:
Silk Rose, I'm a massive fan of *My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic*, it's my favorite show. My favorite pony is Pinkie Pie, and almost everything I do creatively is pony related in some way.

My favorite games are [Factorio], and [Minecraft]. I've made a few [Factorio Mods], and since late 2019, I have been the lead maintainer of [Love & Tolerance], an MLP:FiM-inspired resource pack for Minecraft.

### What:
I love to write, mostly romance, but I want to write all genres. I also, sometimes, make my own covers.

### When:
I had written several stories from 2017 onward, but on Friday, March 31, 2023, at 5:00:55 AM, I committed the first commit to my [Pony] repository, and the rest is history, Git history.

### Where:
All of my writing can be found in my [Pony] repository on GitHub, published or not. All of my published writing can be found on FIMFiction, on my [FIMFiction profile][Silk Rose FIMFiction].

### Why:
- **Writing in the open:** Everything is open for the world to read, whether it gets posted elsewhere or not.
- **Plain text:** My work is stored in plain text Markdown files, no reliance on proprietary software to read or write.
- **Easier to share:** Every story and chapter is just a publicly available link on GitHub.
- **Better versioning:** I can see the history of everything I've written, and easily go back and find it if need be.
- **Free to use:** I license my writing under the Creative Commons Zero 1.0 Universal License, meaning my words are free to do anything with.

### With:
- **[Linux Mint]**, my Operating System of choice. I love Linux for the choice, freedom, and control it gives me over my computer and what I do on in.
- **[Git]**, used to keep track of changes over time, it makes it easy to find anything deleted or changed.
- **[Markdown]**, my file format of choice, makes it easy as Markdown is fairly ubiquitous and most chat applications have most of its syntax built in.
- **[fimd]**, used to convert Markdown into [FIMFiction BBCode]. I use this for every story I publish.
- **[Obsidian]**, a highly customizable and extensible Markdown text editor. I only use features that are present in Markdown, that way everything works on [GitHub].
- **[Syncthing]**, for syncing to and from my computer and phone, makes it super convenient for writing on the go and for backing up my work.
- **[LanguageTool]**, grammar tool of choice, I use the premium version to proofread longer stories.
- **[Obsidian LanguageTool]**, a plugin to use LanguageTool within Obsidian, highly configurable and easy to use.
- **[GIMP]**, an awesome open-source image editor, I make all my covers in it.
- **[MLP Vector Club]**, used to get accurate pony colors when I make any art.
- **[VSCodium]**, I write all my shell scripts in it.
- **[GitHub]**, where I host all of my git repositories, on my [GitHub profile][Silk Rose GitHub]
