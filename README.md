	A collection of stories, ideas, names, and more, all pony related.
</p>

## About:

### Who I am:
Silk Rose, I'm a massive fan of *My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic*, it's my favorite show. My favorite pony is Pinkie Pie, and almost everything I do creatively is pony related in some way.

I love to write stories about ponies. My favorite genre is romance, but I want to write all genres. I also, sometimes, make my own covers.

My favorite games are [Factorio], and [Minecraft]. I've made a few [Factorio Mods], and since late 2019, I have been the lead maintainer of [Love & Tolerance], a MLP:FiM-inspired resource pack for Minecraft.

### Where my work is:
My published writing can be found on my [FIMFiction profile][Silk Rose FIMFiction]; my unpublished writing can be found in my [Pony] repository.

### Why I do it this way:
- **Writing in the open:** Everything is open for the world to read.
- **Plain text:** My work is stored in plain text Markdown files.
- **Easier to share:** Every story and chapter is just a GitHub link away.
- **Better versioning:** I decide when and what to name changes.
- **Free to use:** My writing is free for anyone to do anything with.

### With these tools:
- **[Git]**, used to keep track of changes over time.
- **[Markdown]**, my file format of choice.
- **[fimd]**, used to convert Markdown into [FIMFiction BBCode].
- **[Obsidian]**, a highly customizable and extensible Markdown text editor.
- **[LanguageTool]**, grammar tool of choice, I use the premium version.
- **[Obsidian LanguageTool]**, a plugin to use LanguageTool within Obsidian.
- **[GIMP]**, an image editor, used to make covers.
- **[MLP Vector Club]**, used to get accurate pony colors.
- **[VSCodium]**, I write all my shell scripts in it.

## Directory Structure:
- **Archive:** Anything that is deleted, instead goes here.
- **Flash Fiction:** Short stories, typically written in one sitting.
- **Ponies:** Sprites of ponies, props, and templates, for making covers.
- **Stories:** Story folders for all completed and in-progress work. Also, contains a file for [ideas][Ideas File], and for [names][Names File].

A few of my stories have had readings made for them, I would like to thank the following ponies for doing readings of my work:
