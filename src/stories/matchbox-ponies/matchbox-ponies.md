# Matchbox Ponies

Rainbow cried on Scootaloo's birthday, annually.

Applejack greets her parents every year.

Rarity never forgot their anniversary again.

Twilight failed for the last time.

Rainbow stole all of Twilight's quills.

Twilight named all the monsters killed.

Fluttershy forgot Rainbow after she left.

Pinkie's first kiss was her last.

Applejack couldn't move after the fall.

Pinkie will never forget that coffin.

Lyra and Bonbon lost their rings.

Pinkie Pie loved her first-ever kiss.

Twilight's bedroom window was now open.

Pinkie's party had only one guest.

Rainbow's mane lost all its color.

Scootaloo got the best sister ever.

Twilight's library is bereft of books.

Rainbow's first memory was of Fluttershy.

Scootaloo's wings grew much bigger overnight.

Sweetie Belle never learned to play.

Twilight couldn't read after the incident.

Rainbow Dash lost her fan club.

Celestia's sun is hotter than normal.

Luna's moon is closer than normal.

Fluttershy never saw Angel ever again.

Twilight couldn't handle losing her friends.

Celestia surrendered the castle at Canterlot.

Scootaloo lost her scooter one night.

Luna carved her tears in stone.

Sunset never came back to Equestria.

Fluttershy whimpered as shadows drew closer.

Twilight loved the smell of Pinkie.

Pinkie blushed every time they kissed.

Luna made the stars shine brightly.

Pinkie retired with love around her.

While walking home, Rarity found love.

Without supervision, the apples went bad.

The dust on Twilight's books stagnated.

The sun shone on nopony today.

Rarity loved every Twilight Sparkle embrace.

While watching her, Fluttershy couldn't think.

Twilight never knew about this feeling.

Rainbow finished doing Fluttershy's last chore.

Pinkie never got old to Rarity.

Rarity never forgot Fluttershy's pretty face.

Sweetie Belle loved her sister again.

Fluttershy nursed Rainbow back to health.

When pushed, Twilight overcame her fear.

Pinkie Pie pranks herself this time.

When awoken, Rainbow kissed Fluttershy pink.

Pinkie loved Rarity, even as ashes.

Twilight said what Celestia never did.

Twilight Sparkle loved her more, forever.

Pinkie never forgot, until one day.

Pinkie cried at her own funeral.

Rainbow hit the wall too hard.

The stars in the sky screamed.

Fluttershy never opened _that_ door, again.

Pinkie is stuck, in the dryer.

Fluttershy kissed each friend goodbye, twice.

Twilight failed the test, Equestria exploded.

Pinkie won it, Rainbow's first kiss.

"You," Twilight said before kissing Pinkie.

"No!" Fluttershy screamed in vain, falling.

Pinkie drools on Rarity's chest again.

Twilight kissed Pinkie, who shoves her.

Pinkie ponders, Twilight thinks, Rarity revolts.

Rainbow falls flat, Pinkie inflates her.

Twilight died not knowing of mares.

The flowers wilted in Fluttershy's garden.

Ponies panicked when Celestia's sun disappeared.

Luna doesn't visit my dreams anymore.

One day, Applejack gave up apples.

"I love you," Twilight Sparkle lied.

Pinkie laughed joyously at her will.

Rainbow grinned, as she cried inside.

Rainbow smiled softly as she wept.

Rainbow wept on the turtle shell

Rainbow just barely clipped the ring.

Rainbow taped her own mouth shut.

Luna refused to lower the moon.

Apples aren't selling like they did.

Celestia cried at the occupied moon.

Friendship did not save them all.

She looked up. The rainbow soared.

Her mane went fluttering, then stopped.

"Sweetest pie," she muttered, "where's Pinkie?"

Hair moved between his clawed fingers.

Soon, a new constellation lit up.

Her long horn was firmly grasped.

From her snake tongue slithered lies.

Discord cackled. All went in accord.

She could forgive them. Even her.

The herd happily trampled the streets.

"More cider!" She never had enough.

"No more school," she observed Ponyville.

Never enough time. But what ifâ€¦

There remained nothing but a tree.

The King sat on his throne.

Spell sizzled. The egg didn't hatch.

What, lavender girl? She was bratty.

"Believe!" cried Rainbow, letting Scootaloo go.

Nightmare Moon flared in the stratosphere.

"A phoenix, seriously? Time for testing."

"Is that a blush I see?"

"Pinkie, shut up and kiss me."

I lied, right before catching fire.
