### Short Description
What do you do when your best friend licks your face out of nowhere? You lick back, obviously.

### Ideas
- They take turns assigning words to licks.
- Emphasizing like italics is tilting the action slightly.
- They use charades to convey the words, there is no spoken dialogue in the story.
- They use context clues for harder to guess words.
- Near the end, Pinkie assigns 'love' to a kiss on the lips, surprising Twilight.
- Pinkie says, "I love you," in their new language.
- Twilight doesn't get the true meaning, so Pinkie repeats it, tilting her head when she kisses Twi.
- Once Twilight understands, Pinkie says, "Twilight Sparkle, will you go out with me?" in licks.
- Twilight says yes and they kiss.
