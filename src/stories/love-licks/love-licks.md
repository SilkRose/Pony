# Love Licks

I sit in my study reading a book entitled 'The Construction of Languages'.

I notice somepony open the door, but as the words fly by I forget to look. I can feel a presence beside me, I glance at them for a second before I finish the paragraph I am on. I see Pinkie starring at the book I'm reading, a quizzical look on her face. I stop reading to look at her, she has already turned to me and is leaning closer to me.

Lick.

I sit stunned for a second as I process what Pinkie just did, she *licked* my face.

*What?*

I open my mouth to ask why she had done so, when she closed my mouth with her hoof, instead pointing to the book. I look at the book as she closes it and motions over the tittle with her hoof, 'The Construction of Languages'. She leans close again and licks me again as I try to connect to two instances.

*Language? Lick? What is she doing? How are they connected?*

*Language? Lick? Language? Lick?*

*Language lick? Language lick?*

*Lick language? Lick language?*

Aha!

She's trying to make a language out of *licks*â€¦ what?

She looks at me with pleading eyes, as if she knows I realize what she is trying to do.

Am I really about to do this?

Lick.

Yes, yes I am.

Pinkie looks at me a little surprised with a big smile on her face. I look back, shocked that I am actually doing this. She hugs me.

I start to think, what should the first word be in this language? Probably a greeting, how about 'hello'.

I turn to Pinkie. How do I convey what I want to make a word for to Pinkie if I can talk? Hmm.

Charades, yes, we will act out the word till the other one gets it, then assign it a lick on the other pony.

I put my hoof on Pinkie's back and lead her to the door, stepping out the door she gives me a confused look. I look at her with a smile and node. I knock on the door then point to her, after a few seconds she gets it, nodding back. I close the door and wait for her to knock.

Knock, knock, knock.

I open the door with a smile and instead of saying 'hello', I lean close to her and lick upward an inch from her nose.

I lean back from the encounter, and she smiles at me, letting me know she understands.
