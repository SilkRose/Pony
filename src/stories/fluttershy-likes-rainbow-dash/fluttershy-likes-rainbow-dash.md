# Fluttershy Likes Rainbow Dash

Fluttershy trotted out of her door, almost tripping. Today, she was going to ask Rainbow Dash out, and the thought of asking her out was all she could focus on.

*Today is the day. You've waited too long already.*

Fluttershy slowly trotted to Rainbow’s house as she remembered some of her fondest memories of her crush.

When she first discovered the ground and all its amazing animals due to Rainbow’s race with the bullies.

When they watched the butterfly migration together.

Helping Rainbow find a pet.

Acting in a play with Rainbow.

Rainbow, encouraging her when she thought she was a worthless flyer.

*such great memories, maybe we could make more if we are dating.*

Fluttershy arrived under Rainbow’s cloud home. She slowly lifted herself up to the front door and knocked. Her heart pounded in her chest, she was doing it.

Rainbow dash answered the door and said, "Hi Fluttershy, what's up?"

"I um... I... I wanted to know if you would um... go on a date with me?" Fluttershy asked as her eye's darted around, not wanting to match Rainbow's gaze.

Fluttershy blushed as she waited for Rainbow to answer.

Rainbow Dash stood there, mouth agape in shock, she had definitely not expected this from Fluttershy. She took a moment and thought then said, "Um... sure, Fluttershy, where were you thinking?"

"Sugarcube Corner, tonight at six?" Fluttershy said as her blushed intensified.

“See you then,” Rainbow said before she smiled.

“Bye,” Fluttershy said in a serene tone before she slowly flew away from Rainbow’s home.

On the way home, Fluttershy was so excited and nervous she could hardly think straight.

*What should they do? What should they talk about? Where else should they go?*

Fluttershy had never gone on a date before.

Fluttershy got home and started to prepare for tonight. Seeing as it was noon, she had time to prepare.

She practiced talking with one of her animals wearing a Rainbow Dash mask. She tried flirting and ultimately failed, deciding to just be herself and hope Rainbow would like that.

After hours of trying to prepare and being nervous, it was almost time to leave for Sugarcube Corner.

Fluttershy trotted down the road towards Sugarcube Corner slowly. Fluttershy was nervous and excited, Pinkie would say she was nervicited.

It was five minutes till six, as Fluttershy approached Sugarcube Corner. She opened the door and walked inside.

"Hello Pinkie," Fluttershy said.

Pinkie trotted over to Fluttershy. “What brings you here, Fluttershy?”

“Here to see Rainbow Dash,” she exclaimed. Leaving out the part where it was a date. She didn’t want Pinkie to go all out and make a thing of it, and besides, she would figure out soon enough.

“Can I get you anything in the meantime?” Pinkie asked.

“No, thank you Pinkie, I'll wait,” Fluttershy said.

Moments later, Rainbow Dash entered the establishment.

“Hi Pinkie, hi Fluttershy,” Rainbow said before she took a seat across from Fluttershy.

Fluttershy blushed and said, “Hi.”

Pinkie asked, “What can I get you two Pegasus friends of mine?”

Rainbow Dash answered first, “I'll have the Hay Salad, and some water.”

Fluttershy said, “I'll have the Hay Fries and some water.”

Pinkie went off to do her thing and make the food.

Fluttershy asked, “How was your day?”

“Pretty good,” Rainbow replied. “I’m hoping tonight goes good as well,” she said with a wink.

Fluttershy blushed and said, “Me too.”

They sat silently for a few moments before Rainbow asked, “Why today? Why me?”

Fluttershy said in a low voice, “I just had to know, I couldn’t stand waiting another day, I had to ask you today. It was always going to be you, you’re my closest friend and I really like you.”

Rainbow Dash looked shocked at what Fluttershy had said.

It was then when Pinkie returned with their food, setting it in front of the two ponies. “How’s it going, gals?”

Rainbow replied first, “I’m Good.”

Fluttershy followed, “I’m also Good.”

Pinkie said, “That’s great,” and went on her way back to tending to the store.

“Well,” Rainbow continued from before Pinkie brought them their food, “I’m glad you did, and I’m glad it was me.”

Fluttershy blushed and started eating her salad. Rainbow started eating as well. They sat there eating their food for a bit.

Rainbow finally broke the silence, “So, Fluttershy, what all do you have planned for us tonight?”

Fluttershy replied sheepishly, “First we would eat here to get it started, and then I thought we could go for a midnight stroll to the lake. Where we could sit together and watch the beautiful night sky.”

Rainbow smiled, “That sounds awesome.”

Fluttershy ate her food and watched Rainbow eat hers.

“How is it?” Fluttershy asked.

“Good,” Rainbow said. “No surprise knowing Pinkie, how's yours?”

“Good,” Fluttershy said.

They finished up their food and decided to go on a walk.

They paid for their food and got up to leave. Once outside, they started walking towards the lake.

They got about three quarters the way there when Fluttershy said, “It’s so lovely out tonight.”

Rainbow smirked. “Yeah, I thought you might want to go for a walk tonight, so after you asked me out, I went around and cleared the sky, in ten seconds flat.”

Fluttershy blushed. “You did that for me?” she said bashfully.

Rainbow replied, “Yes.”

Rainbow leaned into Fluttershy as they walked. She felt her tense up and then loosen back down.

Rainbow looked and saw Fluttershy blush intensely. “You know what, Fluttershy, I’ve had a pretty good night tonight,” Rainbow said.

“Yeah,” Fluttershy whispered. “Me too.”

They walked close together, feeling each other's body heat against the cool air. It didn’t take long for them to reach the lake. It was there that Fluttershy unfolded a picnic blanket she had been carrying for this purpose.

They both laid down on the blanket close to the other pony.

Fluttershy said, “There sure are a lot of stars out tonight.”

“Sure are, and I’m looking at one right now,” Rainbow said as she looked at Fluttershy.

Fluttershy blushed, saying quietly, “Oh,” and giggled, causing Rainbow to blush.

They laid there in silence for a minute before Fluttershy asked, “Would you um... like to go on an um... second date... maybe?” She was blushing vigorously.

Rainbow slowly turned towards Fluttershy and leaned closer till their lips were firmly together, they stayed like that for a little bit. Once they parted, Rainbow said, “I would very much like that.”
