# Pink Persuasion

Rarity opens the door. "Hello, Rainbow, thank you for coming."

"No problem, what did you need?"

Rarity leads me inside and over to her couch. Taking a seat, she says, "I'm going to be blunt, I think you should kiss Pinkie on her birthday."

*What?*

My mouth hangs open as Rarity runs damage control.

"Now, I know what you're thinking, darling, it does sound crazy."

"Yes, it does. Why do you want me to kiss her?"

"I just think you two would look cute together."

"That's it?"

"Just think about it, you and Pinkie, loving partners."

"Does Pinkie even like me?"

"Yes… maybe… I think so."

"Did she ask you to do this?"

"Not exactly, I'm just trying to help."

"What if I don't like Pinkie like that?"

"Well, you *do* think she's pretty, right?" Rarity leaned closer, as if more invested.

I can feel a slight blush coming on. "Yes, I think she's pretty, so what?"

"Do you think you could have romantic feelings for her?"

I sit, thinking about it for a moment.

*Why is Rarity trying so hard?*

*This doesn't add up.*

*Could I date Pinkie?*

*She is really pretty, but she's also my best friend.*

*Does that make it more likely we date or less?*

*I don't know all this mushy stuff.*

I think about kissing Pinkie.

*I don't know, it just seems so different.*

"I don't know, maybe."

"That's a start."

"Seriously, why do you care?"

"Rainbow Dash, I just love my friends, I want to see them smile."

"You think Pinkie would be happy with me?"

"I know she would, darling."

"What about me?"

"I hope you would, too."

"What if it doesn't work out? What if we don't like each other like that?"

"You two are such good friends, I think you two would go back to being the bestest of friends."

*Bestest, that's new from Rarity.*

"Let's say, hypothetically, I decide to kiss Pinkie."

"Okay."

"What if she doesn't want me to kiss her?"

"I don't think she would mind a kiss."

"But, you're not her, how would you know?"

"If she didn't like it, I would apologize to her."

"Yeah."

"So, will you kiss her?"

"What about you? Why me? You could kiss her."

"Well, darling, I don't feel that way towards her."

"Before now, neither did I."

"You like her now, though?"

I sigh.

"I don't know."

"What are you unsure about, maybe I can help."

"Relationships, I've never been in one, and now I'm being asked to think about one with my best friend."

"Relationships are a magical thing, Rainbow. They are a partnership, so you wouldn't be alone."

"I guess that's true, but what about the romance? I've never kissed anypony before…"

"Pinkie hasn't either, it could be a learning experience for the both of you."

"How do you know that?"

"I like to know things."
