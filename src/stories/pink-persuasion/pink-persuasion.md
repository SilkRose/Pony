# Pink Persuasion

I knock on the door to Carousel Boutique, waiting for Rarity to answer.

*I don't know what she wants, hopefully it's important.*

Rarity opens the door a moment later. "Hello, Rainbow, thank you for coming."

"No problem, what did you need?"

Rarity leads me inside and over to her couch. We sit down before she says, "I'm going to be blunt, I think you should kiss Pinkie on her birthday."

*What? Did she just ask me to kiss Pinkie Pie?*

My mouth hangs open as Rarity runs damage control.

"Now, I know what you're thinking, darling, it does sound crazy."

"Yes, it does. Why do you want me to kiss her?"

"I just think you two would look cute together."

*Me, cute?*

"That's it?"

"Just think about it, you and Pinkie, loving partners."

"Does Pinkie even like me?"

"I think she has a crush on you."

"Did she ask you to do this?"

"Not exactly, I'm just trying to help."

"What if I don't like Pinkie like that?"

"Well, you *do* think she's pretty, right?" Rarity leans closer, as if more invested.

*I never thought about it before, but Pinkie is kind of hot.*

I can feel a slight blush coming on. "Yes, I think she's pretty, so what?"

"Do you think you could have romantic feelings for her?"

I sit, thinking about it for a moment.

*Why is Rarity trying so hard?*

*This doesn't add up.*

*Could I date Pinkie?*

*She is really pretty, but she's also my best friend.*

*Does that make it more likely we date or less?*

*I don't know all this mushy stuff.*

*Maybe I'd be willing to date her.*

I think about kissing Pinkie.

*I don't know, it just seems so different.*

*She would definitely kiss passionately.*

*Would I?*

*What if I'm a bad kisser?*

I think about her lips pressed against mine as a blush forms on my face.

*Where did that come from?*

"I don't know, I might."

"That's a start."

"Seriously, why do you care?"

"Rainbow Dash, I just love my friends, I want to see them smile."

"You think Pinkie would be happy with me?"

"I know she would, darling."

"What about me?"

"I hope you would, just think about it. Think about holding her hoof, cuddling her in bed, kissing her goodnight, doesn't it all seem so *nice*."

I think about each of those things.

*I think Pinkie would like hoof holding more than me.*

*I might like cuddling with her, she is rather soft.*

*Kissing her goodnight sounds romantic, something I'd want to keep private.*

*I could possibly see myself with her, but what if it doesn't work between us?*

"What if it doesn't work out? What if we don't like each other like that?"

"You two are such good friends, I think you two would go back to being the bestest of friends."

*Bestest, that's new from Rarity.*

"Let's say, hypothetically, I decide to kiss Pinkie."

"Okay."

"What if she doesn't want me to kiss her?"

"I don't think she would mind a kiss."

"But, you're not her, how would you know?"

"If she didn't like it, I would apologize to her."

"Yeah."

"So, will you kiss her?"

"What about you? Why me? You could kiss her."

"Well, darling, I don't feel that way towards her."

"Before now, neither did I."

"You like her now, though?"

I sigh.

"I don't know."

"What are you unsure about, maybe I can help."

"Relationships, I've never been in one, and now I'm being asked to think about one with my best friend."

"Relationships are a magical thing, Rainbow. They are a partnership, so you wouldn't be alone."

"I guess that's true, but what about the romance? I've never kissed anypony before…"

"Pinkie hasn't either, it could be a learning experience for the both of you."

"How do you know that?"

"I like to know things."

"Did Pinkie ask you to do this? Did you ask her if you could do this?"

"It's complicated, Pinkie knows nothing of this."

"So, you just want us to get together?"

"Yes, darling."

"Are you trying to romance our other friends together too?"

"No."

"Why do you think Pinkie would want a kiss from me?"

"I've noticed how different she acts around you."

"How so?"

"She looks at you when you won't notice. Her smile glows when you two hug. She thinks about you when you're not around."

"You really think she likes me?"

"Yes."

"Why do you think she hasn't just asked me out? Pinkie usually isn't afraid to share how she feels."

"Romantic feelings are different, they change how you think. She's probably afraid of being rejected. She's afraid that saying anything would mess with your friendship."

"How long do you think she has felt that way?"

"Twenty-one days… I mean about three weeks."

"That long, huh."

"Yea, so does that mean you'll kiss her?"

"Let me ask you this, why a kiss? Why don't I just talk to her first?"

"It would be a present, you know Pinkie, she loves a surprise."

"Why on her birthday?"

*I kind of thought today was her birthday, must be wrong.*

"Like I said, it would be like a present. I think it would make it more special."

"Okay."

*I guess I'm going to kiss Pinkie.*

"I'll kiss Pinkie."

Rarity hesitates for a second, "Would you like to practice?"

*Did Rarity just ask to kiss? I thought she was trying to get me to kiss Pinkie.*

"What?"

"Like a practice kiss… on the cheek."

"On your cheek?"

"Yes."

*I guess it won't hurt to get feedback.*

I slowly lean close to Rarity, gently kissing her cheek.

Rarity blushes and smiles. "You did great, darling."

*Who know, I might enjoy kissing Pinkie.*

"That wasn't so bad, thanks. So, when is Pinkie's birthday?"

Rarity unzips her costume, revealing she was Pinkie Pie the whole time.

Pinkie jumps out of the costume, landing in my lap.

Pinkie wraps her hooves around my neck, giving me her bedroom eyes. "Today!"
