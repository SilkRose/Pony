# Pony Pillows

Pinkie lays her head down on the side of a sleeping Applejack.

"Nice and soft, with a firm undertone."

She readjusts on her new pillow.

"Where to put my hooves? Hmm."

Pinkie pulls one of Applejack's legs to her chest, holding it.

"Yes, something soft to hold on to. I'm starting to like this pillow."

She nuzzles her pillow to try to get a comfier lay on it.

Her pillow wakes up.

"Huh, whaâ€¦" Applejack says in a daze.

"Shh, pillow, I'm trying to sleep."

"Pillow?" Applejack lifts her head, seeing Pinkie's current resting place. "What are you doing on me, Pinkie?"

"Trying to get some sleep, isn't it obvious?"

"No, it's not. Why are you using me for a pillow?"

"I needed a new pillow, duh."

"Could you, maybe, not use your friend as a pillow?"

"This pillow talks too much, will have to reevaluate."

"What'd ya mean, talks too much? I'm not a pillow!"

"Pillow is also grumpy."

"I'm not the one bargin' in to muh friend's house and using 'em for a pillow."

"Pillow is prone to aggressive outburst, requesting a new pillow."

"Get out!"

"Pillow is very angry, initial retreat protocol!"

"Bye!"

Pinkie lays her head on her new pillow, Rarity.
