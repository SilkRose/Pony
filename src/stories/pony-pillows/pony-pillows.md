# Pony Pillows

Pinkie lays her head down on the side of a sleeping Applejack.

"Nice and soft, with a firm undertone."

She readjusts on her new pillow.

"Where to put my hooves? Hmm."

Pinkie pulls one of Applejack's legs to her chest, holding it.

"Yes, something soft to hold on to. I'm starting to like this pillow."

She nuzzles her pillow to try to get a comfier lay on it.

Her pillow wakes up.

"Huh, wha…" Applejack says in a daze.

"Shh, pillow, I'm trying to sleep."

"Pillow?" Applejack lifts her head, seeing Pinkie's current resting place. "What are you doing on me, Pinkie?"

"Trying to get some sleep, isn't it obvious?"

"No, it's not. Why are you using me for a pillow?"

"I needed a new pillow, duh."

"Could you, maybe, not use your friend as a pillow?"

"This pillow talks too much, will have to reevaluate."

"What'd ya mean, talks too much? I'm not a pillow!"

"Pillow is also grumpy."

"I'm not the one bargin' in to muh friend's house and using 'em for a pillow."

"Pillow is prone to aggressive outburst, requesting a new pillow."

"Get out!"

"Pillow is very angry, initial retreat protocol!"

"Bye!"

Pinkie lays her head on her new pillow, Rarity.

"This pillow is really soft… and very pretty."

Rarity spoke up, "While I do appreciate the compliment, I must ask, why are you in my bed, using me as a pillow?"

"Just trying to find a new pillow, the last one got really angry for some reason."

"Might I ask why you are using ponies as your pillow?"

"They seemed like a good pick, they're really soft, cuddly, and cute."

"Perhaps you would be inclined to use my pillow, and give me the chance to get lost in your beautiful eyes?"

"I didn't know a pillow could make me blush."

"So, is that a yes?"

"But, this pillow is so soft," Pinkie says before nuzzling Rarity's side.

"I bet you'd make a soft pillow," Rarity says as a blush forms on her face.

"This pillow is too flirty."

"I'm not a flirt, I just like what I see."

"Yep, definitely too flirty."

"I'm willing to compromise, how about a kiss?"

"Hmm, fine, one kiss then I'm finding a new pillow."

Pinkie lifts her head up and kisses Rarity passionately.

"Thank you, darling, I'll be your pillow any day."
