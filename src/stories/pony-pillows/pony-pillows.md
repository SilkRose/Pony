# Pony Pillows

Pinkie lays her head down on the side of a sleeping Applejack.

"Nice and soft, with a firm undertone."

She readjusts on her new pillow.

"Where to put my hooves? Hmm."

Pinkie pulls one of Applejack's legs to her chest, holding it.

"Yes, something soft to hold on to. I'm starting to like this pillow."

She nuzzles her pillow to try to get a comfier lay on it.

Her pillow wakes up.

"Huh, wha…" Applejack says in a daze.

"Shh, pillow, I'm trying to sleep."

"Pillow?" Applejack lifts her head, seeing Pinkie's current resting place. "What are you doing on me, Pinkie?"

"Trying to get some sleep, isn't it obvious?"

"No, it's not. Why are you using me for a pillow?"

"I needed a new pillow, duh."

"Could you, maybe, not use your friend as a pillow?"

"This pillow talks too much, will have to reevaluate."

"What'd ya mean, talks too much? I'm not a pillow!"

"Pillow is also grumpy."

"I'm not the one bargin' in to muh friend's house and using 'em for a pillow."

"Pillow is prone to aggressive outburst, requesting a new pillow."

"Get out!"

"Pillow is very angry, initial retreat protocol!"

"Bye!"

Pinkie lays her head on her new pillow, Rarity.

"This pillow is really soft… and very pretty."

Rarity spoke up, "While I do appreciate the compliment, I must ask, why are you in my bed, using me as a pillow?"

"Just trying to find a new pillow, the last one got really angry for some reason."

"Might I ask why you are using ponies as your pillow?"

"They seemed like a good pick, they're really soft, cuddly, and cute."

"Perhaps you would be inclined to use my pillow, so we can talk about *us*?"

"What do you mean *us*?"

"Well… I thought you might be interested in me, seeing as you're currently using me as a pillow and have called me both pretty and cute."

"Maybe later, I'm trying to test sleeping on this new pillow."

"I was trying to get some sleep too, you know."

"We're in agreement, let's both get some sleep."

A few minutes later, Rarity asks, "Would it be okay if I held you?"

"Sure! I'll get a better idea of how soft you are."

Rarity holds Pinkie for a few minutes before Pinkie says, "Okie! On to the next one!"

Pinkie slips free of her grasp, heading for the door.

Rarity cries, "Noooo."

Pinkie lays her head down on a yellow pillow this time, Fluttershy.

"Wow, this one is really soft."

Pinkie nuzzles her pillow's feathers.

"The feathers add so much to the experience. I wonder how squeezable this pillow is. Sometimes you gotta hold on tight."

Pinkie wraps her hooves around Fluttershy and gently squeezes her as she nuzzles her more.

Fluttershy wakes up, lifting her head to see what's going on. "Pinkie…" she says in a confused tone.

"This pillow talks to, aye."

"Pillow?"

"Ugh, I'm trying to find a new pillow, the last three didn't work out."

"I'm your pillow?"

"Yes."

"O- okay."

"Does this pillow have any unique features?"

"Oh, like what?"

Pinkie thinks for a moment before she asks, "Can it sing me a lullaby?"

Fluttershy begins softly singing a lullaby to Pinkie as Pinkie cuddles up with her newest pillow.

*I like this pillow, so far, it's my favorite.*

Fluttershy wraps her hooves around Pinkie, holding her back.

*Aww, such a good pillow.*

A few minutes later, as Pinkie is about to fall asleep, Fluttershy says, "Pinkie?"

"Yes, pillow?"

"I need to use the restroom."

Pinkie sighs. "Dang pillows and their problems."
