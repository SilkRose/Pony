# The Heist of My Heart

A loud noise wakes me up. I look around my bedroom. Not seeing anything, I decide to go back to bed.

A few minutes later, as I am about to fall back to sleep, I hear somepony call my name.

"Twilight?" they say.

I was about to respond when another voice spoke up, one I recognized immediately.

"Pinkie, what are you doing? Are you trying to wake her up?" Rainbow whispered.

*Pinkie and Rainbow are in my room, trying not to wake me up.*

*What are they up to?*

Pinkie whispers back, "Sorry, I was just checking."

Rainbow replies in a whisper, "Just give her a kiss and leave the note, okay?"

*Give me a kiss? What?*

"I'm stealing her heart, remember" Pinkie whispers sheepishly.

*What is she talking about?*

"Okay, you want Twilight to love you, hurry up," Rainbow says in an annoyed whisper.

*Love Pinkie?*

The sound of what is presumably Pinkie Pie trotting quietly towards my bed can be heard.

*What should I do?*

*Do I say something?*

*Should I just pretend to stay asleep?*

I can feel her putting weight on the bed, to my left.

*I need time to think.*

*What if Pinkie stays here?*

*If she's going to kiss me, she can at least give me some company, right?*

I make up my mind as I feel her hoof press down on the bed next to mine.

I can feel her breath on my cheek.

*Now or never.*

I grab her hoof, and hold it against my chest, doing my best to act asleep.

I feel her tense up, she just stands there for a bit.

Rainbow whispers, "What's taking so long?"

Pinkie whispers back, "She grabbed my leg in her sleep."

Rainbow whispers, "Well, pull it out."

Pinkie tries to pull her leg free, but with each try I just hold on tighter, by the time she gives up, I am firmly cuddling her leg.

Pinkie whispers to Rainbow in a worried voice, "I can't, she's got it locked in."

Rainbow takes a moment to reply, eventually whispering, "Lay down with her, she'll let go at some point."

I hear Pinkie gulp before she lays down beside me, I can feel her body beside me on the other side of the blanket.

I lay there in silence for a while, until Pinkie starts to stroke my mane.

*That feels nice.*

"Pinkie, why are you doing that?" Rainbow asked in a whisper.

Pinkie whispered back in a sheepish tone, "I'm sorry, she just looked so cute sleeping there."

I blush. *Good thing the lights are off.*

Rainbow sighs. "Just lay there until she lets go of you."

*Not on my watch.*

I nuzzle her leg against my cheek.

Pinkie whispers, "She's nuzzling my leg."

Rainbow whispers, "Are you sure she's asleep?"

Pinkie whispers back, "I think so."

I lay my head on her leg, using it as a pillow.

*I like this. Her leg makes a soft pillow.*

Pinkie whispers, "Rainbow?"

"Yes?"

"You should probably leave, I think I'm going to be here awhile. She just started using my leg as a pillow."

"Are you sure?"

"Yes, I'll survive the cuteness."

*If you wanted to see something cute, you should've looked in a mirror.*

"Okay, good luck," Rainbow whispers before trotting away.

*I guess it's just me and Pinkie.*

I do my best *totally talking in my sleep voice*, whispering, "…Pinkie's cute…"

I feel her shock, as she moves a little from hearing me speak.

She settles down and whispers, "Sounds like this is going to be one long, adorable night."

*I want a softer pillow; time to get it.*

I push myself closer to Pinkie, moving my head onto her chest. I wrap my right leg around her barrel, holding her.

Pinkie tenses up until I settle into place, before she relaxes, resting a hoof on me, holding me.

I do my sleep voice again, "…so soft…"

Pinkie whispers in a somber tone, "I wish this were for real."

*Maybe it could be?*

I nuzzle her chest as I listen to the rhythmic beating of her heart.

*I really like this; it's nice.*

I can feel her heart rate go up slightly.

We lay there for a good ten minutes or so, before I kiss her chest.

This really gets her, her whole body freezes, she goes stiff for a few seconds.

She relaxes and whispers, "I deserve this, don't I?"

I wait a few minutes before I do my sleep voice again, "…kiss me…"

And to my surprise, she does, she leans close and kisses the top of my head.

After she leans back down on the bed, she whispers, "How's that?"

I don't respond, instead I twitch my right foreleg, the one holding her.

After a few minutes of silence, Pinkie laments, "I don't know what to do, should I be enjoying this? Should I just wake you up? I don't know…"

I wait a few minutes then do my sleep voice again, "…cold…" as I pretend to shiver like I'm cold.

Pinkie wraps her legs around me, holding me tight.

I lay there, enjoying the comforting embrace.

*We definitely need to talk tomorrow, but so far I've really enjoyed being close to you.*

The last thing I remember is saying, "…sleep…" in my sleep voice before actually falling asleep.

***

I wake up from my pillow's rapid heartbeat, opening my eyes, I see I'm still resting on Pinkie Pie.

*I must have fallen asleep on her.*

*How long has she let me sleep on her?*

*Why is her heartbeat so fast?*

I get my answer as Pinkie starts to talk to my sleeping form.

Pinkie whisper's to me, "Twilight, I love you."

I feel my heart flutter. *I think I could love you too.*

She pauses for a second before continuing, "I should have just asked you out normally…"

*With how much I've enjoyed holding, cuddling, and kissing you, I think we will start dating after this.*

She pauses again before she says, "I was going to kiss your cheek then leave a love note, but I guess you had other plans."

*Don't worry, Pinkie, you've stolen my heart, it's yours.*

She finishes by saying, "I'm sorry… I hope you can forgive me when you wake up…" Pinkie trails off as I can hear her trying to sob quietly.

My gut wrenches as I realize I messed up too.

*I should be the one apologizing…*

I squeeze my hold on her a little tighter, trying to still act asleep.

She notices and the tears slow down.

I do my sleep voice again, whispering, "I'm… sorry…"

I can feel Pinkie tense up. *I hope that didn't give me away.*

She whispers, "Twilight, are you awake?"

I don't respond as I try to think of what I should do.

*Maybe we can turn this around. Pinkie did come here for a kiss, maybe I can give it to her?*

*Okay, so my head is on her chest, and my right foreleg is over her stomach. If I want to get my lips near hers, I need to move back and to her right, and pull her towards me as I move so she is facing me.*

I don't like the odds of success, but I do it anyway.

I close my eyes and slid my head backwards as I grab Pinkie. She is surprised by my movement, but doesn't say anything. I finish my move, laying my head on the pillow and wrapping my right hoof around her neck.

I can tell I was successful from Pinkie's breathing, I can feel it on my face.

I can hear the nervousness in her voice as she whispers, "Twilight?"

I don't respond. *Close one.*

A few moments later, she whispers, "You're really cute, especially in your sleep."

*You are really cute too, you know!*

*Maybe I need to see you sleeping, so I can judge the cuteness factor?*

She pauses again before whispering, "It's kinda nice saying this stuff to you while you sleep."

*I should probably kiss you now.*

"As nice as this has been though, I wish I had just told you how I feel. Now I don't know if I'll get the chance too," Pinkie says, sounding like she is about to cry.

*Yes, kiss now.*

I do my best to figure out where her lips are from where her breath is hitting my face. Pushing my face forward, I kiss her, holding her head with my leg.

Pinkie is surprised as I feel her tense up, but moments later she kisses back.

I can feel my cheeks blush as I hold the kiss for a very long time, keeping my eyes closed.

*My gosh, if I knew it was this good to kiss Pinkie, I would've asked her out.*

I let go of Pinkie, ending the kiss. I open my eyes to a stunned Pinkie, just staring at me mouth agape. *Her blush could probably match mine.*

"Wha… huh… um…" Pinkie tries to speak.

I say, "I'm sorry, Pinkie."

Pinkie composes herself. "What for?"

"I wasn't asleep the whole time…"

"Oh… so you heard what I said?" Pinkie asked as her blush intensified again.

"Yes, but you don't need to worry about anything. You came here to steal my heart, well I'd say you succeeded. It's yours."

"Does that mean what I think it does?" Pinkie said as a smile formed on her lips.

"Yes Pinkie, will you go out with me?"

Her eyes sparkle. "Yes."

I ask, "What does the note say?"

Pinkie gives me the note, pulling it from her mane.

I read the note.

> Twilight,  
> Can I please have your heart?  
> ~Pinkie  
> P.S. You're cute!!  

I kiss her again, this one short and sweet. "Yes, you can have my heart."

We both smile and blush at each other for a few seconds.

I say, "As I was hugging, cuddling, and kissing you, I realized how much I liked it."

"I liked it too," Pinkie said bashfully. "Would've liked it more if I wasn't worrying the whole time."

"I'm sorry I pretended to be asleep, let me make it up to you?"

"How?"

"We still have a few hours until it's time to get up. Get under the blanket and let me hold you while we sleep."

"I'd love that," Pinkie said serenely.

Pinkie gets under the blanket, scooting close to me. I lay her head on my chest, wrapping my forelegs around her.

I kiss the top of her head and whisper, "Goodnight, Pinkie."

Pinkie kisses my chest before she whispers back, "Goodnight, Twilight."
