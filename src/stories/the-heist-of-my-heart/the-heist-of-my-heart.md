# The Heist of My Heart



***

I wake up from my pillow's rapid heartbeat, opening my eyes, I see I'm still resting on Pinkie Pie.

*I must have fallen asleep on her.*

*How long has she let me sleep on her?*

*Why is her heartbeat so fast?*

I get my answer as Pinkie starts to talk to my sleeping form.

Pinkie whisper's to me, "Twilight, I love you."

I feel my heart flutter. *I think I could love you too.*

She pauses for a second before continuing, "I should have just asked you out normally…"

*With how much I've enjoyed holding, cuddling, and kissing you, I think we will start dating after this.*

She pauses again before she says, "I was going to kiss your cheek then leave a love note, but I guess you had other plans."

*Don't worry, Pinkie, you've stolen my heart, it's yours.*

She finishes by saying, "I'm sorry… I hope you can forgive me when you wake up…" Pinkie trails off as I can hear her trying to sob quietly.

My gut wrenches as I realize I messed up too.

*I should be the one apologizing…*

I squeeze my hold on her a little tighter, trying to still act asleep.

She notices and the tears slow down.

I do my best *totally talking in my sleep voice*, whispering, "I'm… sorry…"

I can feel Pinkie tense up. *I hope that didn't give me away.*

She whispers, "Twilight, are you awake?"

I don't respond as I try to think of what I should do.

*Maybe we can turn this around. Pinkie did come here for a kiss, maybe I can give it to her?*

*Okay, so my head is on her chest, and my right foreleg is over her stomach. If I want to get my lips near hers, I need to move back and to her right, and pull her towards me as I move so she is facing me.*

I don't like the odds of success, but I do it anyway.

I close my eyes and slid my head backwards as I grab Pinkie. She is surprised by my movement, but doesn't say anything. I finish my move, laying my head on the pillow and wrapping my right hoof around her neck.

I can tell I was successful from Pinkie's breathing, I can feel it on my face.

I can hear the nervousness in her voice as she whispers, "Twilight?"

I don't respond. *Close one.*

A few moments later, she whispers, "You're really cute, especially in your sleep."

*You are really cute too, you know!*

*Maybe I need to see you sleeping, so I can judge the cuteness factor?*

She pauses again before whispering, "It's kinda nice saying this stuff to you while you sleep."

*I should probably kiss you now.*

"You know, I could kiss you right now, but I can't do that to you, not without your consent. Heck, I'm going to consider myself lucky if you want to remain friends when you wake up."

*Yes, kiss now.*

I do my best to figure out where her lips are from where her breath is hitting my face. Pushing my face forward, I kiss her, holding her head with my leg.

Pinkie is surprised as I feel her tense up, but moments later she kisses back.

I can feel my cheeks blush as I hold the kiss for a very long time, keeping my eyes closed.

*My gosh, if I knew it was this good to kiss Pinkie, I would've asked her out.*

I let go of Pinkie, ending the kiss. I open my eyes to a stunned Pinkie, just staring at me mouth agape. *Her blush could probably match mine.*

"Wha… huh… um…" Pinkie tries to speak.

I say, "I'm sorry, Pinkie."

Pinkie composes herself. "What for?"

"I wasn't asleep the whole time…"

"Oh… so you heard what I said?" Pinkie asked as her blush intensified again.

"Yes, but you don't need to worry about anything. You came here to steel my heart, well I'd say you succeeded, it's yours."

"Does that mean what I think it does?" Pinkie said as a smile formed on her lips.

"Yes Pinkie, will you go out with me?"

Her eyes sparkle. "Yes."

I kiss her again, this one short and sweet.

I say, "As I was hugging, cuddling, and kissing you, I realized how much I liked it."

"I liked it too," Pinkie said bashfully. "Would've liked it more if I was worrying the whole time."

"Well, let me make it up to you."

"How?"

"We still have a few hours until it's time to get up. Get under this blanket and we can cuddle while we sleep."

"I'd love that," Pinkie said in a serene voice.

Pinkie gets under the blanket, scooting close to me. I lay her head on my chest, wrapping my forelegs around her.

I kiss the top of her head and whisper, "Goodnight, Pinkie."

Pinkie kisses my chest before she whispers back, "Goodnight, Twilight."
