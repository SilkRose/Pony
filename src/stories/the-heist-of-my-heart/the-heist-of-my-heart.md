# The Heist of My Heart



***

I wake up from my pillow's rapid heartbeat, opening my eyes, I see I'm still resting on Pinkie Pie.

*I must have fallen asleep on her.*

*How long has she let me sleep on her?*

*Why is her heartbeat so fast?*

I get my answer as Pinkie starts to talk to my sleeping form.

Pinkie whisper's to me, "Twilight, I love you."

I feel my heart flutter. *I think I could love you too.*

She pauses for a second before continuing, "I should have just asked you out normally…"

*With how much I've enjoyed holding, cuddling, and kissing you, I think we will start dating after this.*

She pauses again before she says, "I was going to kiss your cheek then leave a love note, but I guess you had other plans."

*Don't worry, Pinkie, you've stolen my heart, it's yours.*

She finishes by saying, "I'm sorry… I hope you can forgive me when you wake up…" Pinkie trails off as I can hear her trying to sob quietly.

My gut wrenches as I realize I messed up too.

*I should be the one apologizing…*

I squeeze my hold on her a little tighter, trying to still act asleep.

She notices and the tears slow down.

I do my best *totally talking in my sleep voice*, whispering, "I'm… sorry…"

I can feel Pinkie tense up. *I hope that didn't give me away.*

She whispers, "Twilight, are you awake?"

I don't respond as I try to think of what I should do.

*Maybe we can turn this around. Pinkie did come here for a kiss, maybe I can give it to her?*

*Okay, so my head is on her chest, and my right foreleg is over her stomach. If I want to get my lips near hers, I need to move back and to her right, and pull her towards me as I move so she is facing me.*

I don't like the odds of success, but I do it anyway.

I close my eyes and slid my head backwards as I grab Pinkie. She is surprised by my movement, but doesn't say anything. I finish my move, laying my head on the pillow and wrapping my right hoof around her neck.

I can tell I was successful from Pinkie's breathing, I can feel it on my face.

I can hear the nervousness in her voice as she whispers, "Twilight?"

I don't respond. *Close one.*

A few moments later, she whispers, "You're really cute, especially in your sleep."

*You are really cute too, you know!*

*Maybe I need to see you sleeping, so I can judge the cuteness factor?*

She pauses again before whispering, "It's kinda nice saying this stuff to you while you sleep."

*I should probably kiss you now.*

"You know, I could kiss you right now, but I can't do that to you, not without your consent. Heck, I'm going to consider myself lucky if you want to remain friends when you wake up."

*Yes, kiss now.*

I do my best to figure out where her lips are from where her breath is hitting my face. Pushing my face forward, I kiss her, holding her head with my leg.

Pinkie is surprised as I feel her tense up, but moments later she kisses back.

I can feel my cheeks blush as I hold the kiss for a very long time, keeping my eyes closed.

*My gosh, if I knew it was this good to kiss Pinkie, I would've asked her out.*

I let go of Pinkie, ending the kiss. I open my eyes to a stunned Pinkie, just staring at me mouth agape. *Her blush could probably match mine.*
