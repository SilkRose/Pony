### Synopsis

Synopsis: A Pegasus stallion (Flywheel Weld) who is missing a wing wants to help the mare who saved his grandfather’s life, so he fixes her broken wagon wheel on her medical wagon. Seeing how fancy her medical equipment is and how she performs medicine, he wants to travel with her and save lives, deciding he has nothing left to do in his small town. His family are supportive, but don’t think he will be able to convince the medic to let him come. After a long talk of convincing and compromising, she agrees to let him come, seeing the spark she had when she started helping ponies. Rose (the medic pony) gets a telegram from a sick pony in desperate need of her help. The two have to leave town at night to get there on time. They take turns pulling the wagon in the starlight, talking and becoming friends along the way. The Pegasus reveals how he lost his right wing, in turn Rose reveals she’s blind in her left eye. Rose starts to get tired, so he offers to pull the wagon and let her sleep, so she can be well rested to treat the patient when they show up. Rose went to sleep happy, glad to finally has some company and help. The stallion felt lonely without her to talk to, but trod onward to make sure their patient could be helped, glad to be able to. Rose slept fairly well, almost waking up a few times from the bumps, but thankfully not, after about 6 hours the wagon hit a bump so hard Rose fell out of her bed, landing on the floor on her back. Yelping out in pain, she lay on the floor prone. The stallion quickly checked on her and apologized profusely. Rose said it was alright and had him help her up, she then told him about her bad back from pulling the wagon everywhere. The stallion offers to build a retaining rail to keep it from happening again. Rose asked if he was good enough to do it while she pulled the wagon the rest of the way, he said yes, and off they went.
