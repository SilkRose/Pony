Flywheel Weld sat on a bench on his family's front porch. He had been waiting for a little of an hour there, checking left and right, as if any moment something would appear. Sweat trickled down his face in the hot sun, whatever he was waiting on must have been important.

Eventually something did catch his eye, a small gray dot coming up the road towards him. As it got closer, he saw a brown wagon behind it. He eagerly awaited her arrival, surely this had to be her. He watched as a gray mare came into view, she had a white mane and rose-pink eyes, she was a unicorn.

The unicorn pulled up to his house, she turned to him and asked, "Is this the home of Flywheel Weld?"

Flywheel smiled at the mare, "It sure is, ma'am, you're speaking to him."

The unicorn unhooked herself from the wagon and walked over to Flywheel, holding out her hoof, "My name is Silk Rosette, but everyone calls me Rose."

Flywheel shakes her hoof, "pleasure to make the acquaintance, would you like to come inside?"

Rose replied, "Sure."

Flywheel leads Rose inside, closing the door behind them, he notices the writing on her wagon "Rose's Roaming Respite".

Rose turned to Flywheel, asking, "Could you tell me more about your grandpa? I know in the telegram you said he was having trouble breathing."
