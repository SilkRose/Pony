# Introduction

“I have to admit, a unicorn forest does sound kinda magical”, Hitch says with a smile as he looks at Sunny.

Sunny replies, “we’ll find out tomorrow, let's get some sleep, we need to be at our best if we’re going to bring back Equestria’s magic.”

The group all nod and lay down around the campfire, saying their good nights to each other. They all close their eyes and start to drift off, except for Hitch.

Hitch lies on the cold ground, closest to the elements, he shivers from the cold breeze.

*Brr*, he involuntarily makes a noise. *Hopefully no one heard that. I’ll be fine sleeping here,* he thought to himself.
