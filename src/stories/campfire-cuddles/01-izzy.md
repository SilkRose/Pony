# Izzy

Izzy perked her ears up at the sound of a cold sheriff. She raised her head from her hooves and saw Hitch was shivering beside her. *I’ve got to help him*, she thought.

Izzy scooted closer to him and put a hoof on his back, “you need some warmth?” she asked innocently.

Hitch looked up at her, then pondered for a moment, likely deciding if he was okay with this. He eventually whispered back, “sure.”

Izzy scoots back to her spot and pats the ground next to her, indicating for Hitch to move there. Hitch moves there and stares into Izzy’s eyes, she stares back for a moment.

Hitch thinks to himself, *those are some cute eyes.*

Izzy whispers to Hitch, “good night,” in a silk-like voice.

Hitch whispers back, “good night.”

Closing their eyes, they rest against each other, foreheads touching.

Hitch thinks to himself as he’s falling asleep, *this is a lot better than being cold.*

***

Izzy woke up in the middle of the night to Hitch talking in his sleep.

“…zy has pretty eyes,” Hitch mumbled.

Izzy blushed slightly at these words. *He’s dreaming about me.* *What should I do?* She pondered.
