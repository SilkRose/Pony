# The Best Sister Never

## Day 1

Dear Diary,

This new town seems pretty nice, it's called Ponyville. Mom and dad say they won't be gone for long, but I know they're lying, just like last time.

But, enough about them, I wanna talk about Ponyville some more. I really hope I can make some new friends her, I think I'm not the only blank flank, isn't that exciting!

Anyway, I'll see you tomorrow.

## Day 2

Dear Diary,

Today at school was rough, I didn't get a chance to talk to any other blank flanks, not that they would want to be my friend anyway…

I told myself I wouldn't cry…

The teacher seems nice, maybe she's someone I can talk to, I hope so.

There are so many ponies in my class, I felt so lonely standing up front as the teacher introduced me. I'm pretty sure a couple of the kids are bullies, no doubt going to introduce themselves soon enough.

Maybe tomorrow will be better?

## Day 5

Dear Diary,

Finally, something good happened in this town! I made a friend, her name is Applebloom. She's a yellow earth pony. She's a blank flank like me, so we bonded immediately.

We hung out after school on her families farm, it was surprisingly fun.

When we were there, I accidentally broke a wagon wheel by falling into it. I… thought they were going to hit me… they acted really strange after that.

I left shorty after, maybe tomorrow I can say I'm sorry.

## Day 8

## Day 54

Dear Diary,

Today, I almost died, I fell down a waterfall. I was being stupid, I tried to face my fears. Well, I'll never do that again… I hate Princess Luna, it's all her fault.

We all went on a camping trip, including Rainbow Dash! I tried so hard to get her to notice me, but nothing worked, she just didn't care…

I shared a tent with Rainbow, I thought this was my moment, a chance to finally make my mark, but she snored like a dinosaur the whole time…

The whole night I was terrified of the headless horse, so when I was the only one awake at night, I went to face them.

It didn't end well, I fell down a waterfall. As I was falling, my life didn't flash in front of my eyes, no, Rainbow Dash did, and not in real life from saving me, from how much I wanted her to be my sister. I was screaming for help, hoping Rainbow would come save me, but she never did.

I survived and dragged myself back to the cave, bloody and bruised.

I hate my life.

## Day 75

Dear Diary,

I hate Rainbow Dash, I hate her, hate her, hate her, hate her!

I tried talking to her today, about maybe being her sister… She said no…

I broke down crying right there. Then she called me weird for crying. I tried to explain myself, but she didn't want to hear anything.

I'm just done. I don't want to cry anymore, I don't want to have hope anymore, it's too painful. I just want to go away.

So, this is goodbye, from Scootaloo, forever.

P.S. Rainbow, if you're reading this, I hate you!!
