## Unnamed Rainbow x Rarity romance story

### Synopsis:
Rarity and Rainbow are lost in the wilderness and become close as they find their way home.

### Snippet:
Rainbow Dash led Rarity through some brush, slowly trying to find a path. She stopped and started to look around, not seeing anything. She was about to continue walking when she heard a sob, looking back at Rarity, she could tell she wasn't okay. Her mane was completely disheveled, her makeup had completely run off, her mouth was hung low, and her ears were drooping, but it was her eyes that caught her attention most, she could see the wetness in them.

*She's trying so hard not to cry*, Rainbow thought.

Rainbow sat down and said, "Let's take a break for a moment."

"Okay," Rarity said while choking back a sob.

"Hey, we're going to get thought this, okay?" Rainbow said.

"How do you know that?" Rarity said between labored breathes.

"Because I do, we got each other and that's all we need," Rainbow tried to say with confidence, but failed.

"We're miserable Rainbow Dash, we look like wild animals, and we haven't eaten in over a day, what are we going to do?" Rarity snapped at her before letting the floodgates loose. Tears started flowing from her eyes as she started to sob, "I don't want to dieâ€¦"

Rainbow Dash pulled Rarity close, wrapping both her wings and forelegs around her. "Shh, it's going to be fine, I'll make sure we get home."
