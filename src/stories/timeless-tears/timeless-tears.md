# Timeless Tears



***



I press my lips to Pinkie's, kissing her passionately.

*I love her.*

*I love Pinkie.*

I feel hooves wrap around me, making me cry.

*This isn't real.*

*It has to be real…*

Then, Fluttershy opened her eyes.

Fluttershy looked around the room, realizing she's in Pinkie's bedroom.

Fluttershy's eyes stopped on Pinkie, who came rushing over.

"I knew you'd wake up! I knew you'd always come back!" Pinkie said before wrapping her in a tight hug.

"Pinkie…"

"Yes?"

"I love you," Fluttershy said, crying.

"I love you too," Pinkie said, also crying.

After the hug, they both stared into each other's eyes, making a silent agreement.

Fluttershy started to lean in, then Pinkie.

Their lips met as they executed on their agreement.

Both ponies released years of passion into a single kiss, tears flowing endlessly.
