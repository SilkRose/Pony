# Timeless Tears


"Fluttershy, are you sure you can handle taking care of Pinkie by yourself?" Twilight asked.

Fluttershy set me down on her couch, laying sideways. "Yes."

*Hey, I can't see anything!*

"Okay, just let me know if you need anything. I'm sorry you have to do this."

"I want to do it, for her."

*Thank you.*

"Hopefully, she comes out of it soon."

"Agreed."

*Me too.*

"Did the doctors give you the list of her needs?"

"Yes, I'll make sure she gets pampered."

*If I could move, I would hug you.*

"Sounds good."

"I've got everything under control."

"Thank you."

I hear hooves on the ground before Twilight says, "Goodbye, Fluttershy."

"Goodbye, Twilight."

Somepony hugs me from behind. "Goodbye, Pinkie. I want to see your smile soon, okay?"

*Got it!*

Twilight leaves Fluttershy cottage.

As soon as the door was closed, Fluttershy broke.

She rushes over and hugs me from behind, shaking.

*I'm sorry…*

"Pinkie…"

She starts to sob uncontrollably, holding me tight.

*Don't cry…*

"Pinkie…"

"I don't know what to do without you…"

*I'm still here.*

"I was going to tell you…"

*Tell me what?*

"I love you…"

*I love you too!*

"I was going to ask you out…"

*Yes, I will go out with you!*

"I miss you so much already."

*If only I could hug you…*

"I'll never give up on you."

*Thank you.*

"Pinkie."

*Fluttershy.*

"I love you…"

*I love you too!*

Fluttershy lifts me up, putting me in a sitting position with my forelegs pressing into the bed.

*Hi!*

She hugs me, doing her best to wrap my hooves around her.

*I would hug you back if I could.*

I hear her sniffle as she hugs me tight.

*I wish I could stop your tears.*

She pulls back from the hug, holding my head upright. "Pinkie, I'm sorry. I have to kiss you."

More tears fall from her face as she leans in to kiss me.

*Yes, Fluttershy. Kiss me!*

Fluttershy kisses me, doing her best without reciprocation.

*I want to kiss back so badly.*

Fluttershy wraps her hooves around my neck, holding my head as she closes her eyes.

As we kiss, my lip twitches.

*What?*

I blink my eyes, voluntary.

*WHAT?*

I reciprocate the kiss, immediately and with passion.

I shakily lift my hooves, wrapping them around her.

I hold her as tight as I can as her tears endlessly flow.

*This is real, I can move!*

*I love you, Fluttershy. I love you. I love you. I love you!*

Fluttershy opens her eyes as an endless stream of tears runs down my face.

We hold the kiss as we both release years of pent-up passion.

We break the kiss and I say the only thing I can think of.

"I love you, Fluttershy!"

"I love you, Pinkie!"
