# Timeless Tears



***

"Pinkie."

*Fluttershy.*

"I love youâ€¦"

*I love you too!*

Fluttershy lifts me up, putting me in a sitting position with my forelegs pressing into the bed.

*Hi!*

She hugs me, doing her best to wrap my hooves around her.

*I would hug you back if I could.*

I hear her sniffle as she hugs me tight.

*I wish I could stop your tears.*

She pulls back from the hug, holding my head upright. "Pinkie, I'm sorry. I have to kiss you."

More tears fall from her face as she leans in to kiss me.

*Yes, Fluttershy. Kiss me!*

Fluttershy kisses me, doing her best without reciprocation.

*I want to kiss back so badly.*

Fluttershy wraps her hooves around my neck, holding my head as she closes her eyes.

As we kiss, my lip twitches.

*What?*

I blink my eyes, voluntary.

*WHAT?*

I reciprocate the kiss, immediately and with passion.

I shakily lift my hooves, wrapping them around her.

I hold her as tight as I can as her tears endlessly flow.

*This is real, I can move!*

*I love you, Fluttershy. I love you. I love you. I love you!*

Fluttershy opened her eyes.
