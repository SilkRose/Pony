# Timeless Tears


"Fluttershy, are you sure you can handle taking care of Pinkie by yourself?" Twilight asked.

Fluttershy set me down on her couch, laying sideways. "Yes."

*Hey, I can't see anything!*

"Okay, just let me know if you need anything. I'm sorry you have to do this."

"I want to do it, for her."

*Thank you.*

"Hopefully, she comes out of it soon."

"Agreed."

*Me too.*

"Did the doctors give you the list of her needs?"

"Yes, I'll make sure she gets pampered."

*If I could move, I would hug you.*

"Sounds good."

"I've got everything under control."

"Thank you."

I hear hooves on the ground before Twilight says, "Goodbye, Fluttershy."

"Goodbye, Twilight."

Somepony hugs me from behind. "Goodbye, Pinkie. I want to see your smile soon, okay?"

*Got it! Goodbye.*

Twilight leaves Fluttershy cottage.

As soon as the door was closed, Fluttershy broke.

She rushes over and hugs me from behind, shaking.

*I'm sorry…*

"Pinkie…"

She starts to sob uncontrollably, holding me tight.

*Don't cry…*

"Pinkie…"

"I don't know what to do without you…"

*I'm still here.*

"I was going to tell you…"

*Tell me what?*

"I love you…"

*I love you too!*

"I was going to ask you out…"

*Yes, I will go out with you!*

"I miss you so much already."

*If only I could hug you…*

"I'll never give up on you."

*Thank you.*

"How is Pinkie doing, darling?" Rarity asks.

"She's doing alright, I'm doing my best and giving her plenty of love."

"That's good. What about you? Are you holding up alright? I heard that you've started sleeping in the same bed."

"I'm good, I just want to make sure she isn't lonely… I think Pinkie likes sharing a bed…"

*I love it!*

*I love you…*

"Well, if you're certain, I just want to make sure you're alright, and not putting too much of you onto Pinkie."

"I could never do anything bad to her."

*Yay.*

"Good to hear."

"Rarity?"

"Do you think she will come back?"

"I know some of the others are less certain, but I'm confident she will."

*Oh…*

"Thank you."

"You love her, don't you, darling?"

"Yes."

*I love her back.*

"She's still in there, just waiting to come back to us."

*I am.*

"I know… I talk to her everyday. A bit one-sided, but I try to keep her sane."

*You're doing amazing!*

"When she comes back, she's going to give you some hug."

*Yes.*

"I'll be waiting, as long as it takes."

*Aww.*

"Sounds like she is good hooves."

"Thank you."

"I'm going to get going, darling, it was a pleasure talking to you."

"Goodbye, Rarity."

*Goodbye.*

"Goodbye."

With that Rarity left.

I hear Fluttershy walking over to me, she starts stroking my back.

*That feels good.*

"I love you, Pinkie, so much…"

*I love you too!*

She leans down and kisses my cheek.

*:)*

Moments later, I feel her tears hitting my back.

"Fluttershy, we need to talk, about Pinkie," Rainbow says.

*Me?*

"What about Pinkie?"

"You're too attached to her, you spend more time with her than us."

*I like spending time with Fluttershy…*

"Well, she doesn't have a life, I'm trying to give her one…"

*You have!*

"We don't even know whether she's conscious or not."

*I am.*

"She is."

"How do you know?"

"She has to be…"

"How are you so sure?"

"I see it in her eyes, she's still in there, and she's awake."

"That doesn't change the fact that you care more about her than us."

"I have to because no one else seems to care about her."

"We care."

"Do you? When was the last time you can over to see her? Twilight and Rarity are the only ones that still come to visit her."

"Fluttershy it's been years, it's really hard to do this for that long."

"I should know, I'm the one doing it. Have you ever offered to feed her? To bathe her? To tuck her in at night, or read her a bedtime story? No, you haven't"

*Fluttershy does an amazing job.*

"I'm sorry…"

"I'm not the one you should be apologizing to."

Rainbow acknowledges my existent. "Pinkie, I'm sorry I've been a bad friend."

*Apology accepted.*

Rainbow comes over to me, and hugs me. "I'm so sorry…"

*I would cry if I could.*

I can feel her tears sliding down my fur.

*You did it for me.*

Fluttershy and Rainbow pick me up, holding me in a three-way hug.

"Pinkie, I love you, with all my heart," Fluttershy says.

"I love you, Pinkie," Rainbow says, still crying.

*I love you both. I love you both so much.*

***

"Pinkie."

*Fluttershy.*

"I love you…"

*I love you too!*

Fluttershy lifts me up, putting me in a sitting position with my forelegs pressing into the bed.

*Hi!*

She hugs me, doing her best to wrap my hooves around her.

*I would hug you back if I could.*

I hear her sniffle as she hugs me tight.

*I wish I could stop your tears.*

She pulls back from the hug, holding my head upright. "Pinkie, I'm sorry. I have to kiss you."

More tears fall from her face as she leans in to kiss me.

*Yes, Fluttershy. Kiss me!*

Fluttershy kisses me, doing her best without reciprocation.

*I want to kiss back so badly.*

Fluttershy wraps her hooves around my neck, holding my head as she closes her eyes.

As we kiss, my lip twitches.

*What?*

I blink my eyes, voluntary.

*WHAT?*

I reciprocate the kiss, immediately and with passion.

I shakily lift my hooves, wrapping them around her.

I hold her as tight as I can as her tears endlessly flow.

*This is real, I can move!*

*I love you, Fluttershy. I love you. I love you. I love you!*

Fluttershy opens her eyes as an endless stream of tears runs down my face.

We hold the kiss as we both release years of pent-up passion.

We break the kiss and I say the only thing I can think of.

"I love you, Fluttershy!"

"I love you, Pinkie!"
