# Shower Coffee

Twilight closes the door behind her and runs to her seat in the castle's map room.

Twilight sits down. "Sorry I'm late girls, I had to finish showering and I barely got to finish my shower coffee."

Rarity speaks up, "I'm sorry, darling, did you just say *shower coffee*?"

Everypony turns to Twilight with quizzical expressions on their faces.

Twilight says, "Yes, shower coffee, you've all had shower coffee, right?"

All five other ponies shook their head.

Rarity asked, "What is shower coffee?"

Twilight answers, "It's coffee you drink in the shower."

Everypony seemed to have a problem with this.

Applejack says, "That doesn't seem very practical."

Rarity comments, "Wouldn't you get water in your coffee?"

Pinkie adds to it, "Or soap?"

Fluttershy asks, "What if you accidentally spill the coffee and burn yourself?"

Rainbow says, "Why don't you just drink the coffee then shower?"

Twilight calms them down, and answers each of their concerns.

She turns to Applejack. "As long as you're careful, it can be very practical."

Then to Rarity. "I keep it outside the shower and drink on it throughout the shower."

Pinkie. "I stick my head out of the shower to drink it."

Fluttershy. "I am careful and have never spilled it."

Rainbow. "It saves time to drink it in the shower and more importantly, the coffee just tastes better in the shower."

Nopony seems satisfied with the answers they got.

Rarity asks, "How does it taste better?"

Applejack asks, "What coffee do you drink, Twilight?"

Pinkie asks, "What do you add to your coffee? I like a lot of sugar."

Fluttershy asks, "How much better does it taste?"

Rainbow asks, "Should I try it?"

Twilight once again addressed each pony.

Rarity. "It just does, I don't know exactly why. I think it's probably from the temperature of the shower water."

Applejack. "I drink the same coffee as you, I think."

Pinkie. "Three cream, two sugars."

Fluttershy. "A surprising amount, actually."

Rainbow. "Go ahead, but you should be careful since you don't have magic to hold the cup for you."

This seems to satisfy most, as she only got two questions this round.

Rarity asks, "What temperature showers do you take?"

Pinkie asks, "How did you learn about shower coffee?"

Twilight answers, "I like my showers warm, but not too hot. And I saw Spike leaving the bathroom with a cup of coffee, I asked him about it, and he told me about shower coffee."

All five other ponies seemed satisfied.

Twilight says, "Now, let's get to why we are actually here."

***

Rarity set her steaming cup of coffee on the towel rack outside her shower.

She started the water and got in.

*This is silly, there is no way this will be good, right?*

She took a sit after washing her mane.

*It's not that good.*

She washes slightly faster after that.

After washing her face, she takes two more sips.

*Yep, it's better, but not by much.*

She washes even faster, getting her barrel clean.

She takes a gulp of coffee.

*Nice to wake you up, but nothing to write home about.*

She finishes her shower, taking a big drink of coffee.

*Now, where is Applejack? I need to help her on the farmâ€¦*

Rainbow set her coffee next to her shower, placing a straw in it that lead into her shower.

She starts the water and gets it.

*There is no way this is good.*

She washes her head, then takes a drink.

She frowns.

*I hate how good it is.*

She washes her wings, then takes another drink.

*Yep, this is good.*

*I hate it.*

She angrily washes her legs.

Taking another drink, she thinks to herself.

*I'm going to have to do this every time I shower.*

She finishes showering.

*It's all Twilight's fault.*
