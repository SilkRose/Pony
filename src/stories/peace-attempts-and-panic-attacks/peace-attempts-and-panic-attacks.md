# Peace Attempts and Panic Attacks

I run past the door for the first time today, finally having the courage.

I stop at the end of the hallway, looking at myself in a mirror.

I see a disheveled Fluttershy staring back at me, matted fur, split ends, bags under my eyes.

*You can't keep living like this, Fluttershy.*

*I know, I've got to do something…*

I hear it bash against the door. I instinctively huddle on the floor, water already in my eyes.

*I can't do it.*

*I can't.*

*I have to try,* I think as I try to calm myself.

I finally stop crying as I get my thoughts together, standing up.

*Maybe I can make peace by offering it something.*

*But what?*

*It hasn't been outside that room for weeks, maybe it wants food.*

*But the food is back down the hallway…*

*Oh, no.*

I stare down the hallway as I try to mentally prepare for going back.

*You can do it, Fluttershy.*

I ran down the hallway… and tripped, landing right in front of the door.

*No, no, no, no, no, no!*

I rush away, hooves slipping on the floor as my visions blurs.

I make it to the bottom of the stairs, collapsing on the floor.

I hear it bash itself against the door over and over, each time I curl up into a tighter ball.

My vision goes black as I whimper to myself, tears streaking to the floor.

The thought of the door opening won't leave my mind, making my work shake and spin.

My vision comes back as I calm down, still too afraid to look up.

I lay there for an unknown amount of time, losing all sense of time.

Eventually I lift my head, shaking profusely. Looking around, I see I am alright, for now…

I sit up, remembering what I was doing.

*Oh, yea, food offering.*

I get up and slowly walk upstairs, as if making a noise would release *it*.
