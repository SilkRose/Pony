# Peace Attempts and Panic Attacks

I run past the door for the first time today, finally having the courage.

I stop at the end of the hallway, looking at myself in a mirror.

I see a disheveled Fluttershy staring back at me, matted fur, split ends, bags under my eyes.

*You can't keep living like this, Fluttershy.*

*I know, I've got to do something…*

I hear it bash against the door. I instinctively huddle on the floor, water already in my eyes.

*I can't do it.*

*I can't.*

*I have to try,* I think as I try to calm myself.

I finally stop crying as I get my thoughts together, standing up.

*Maybe I can make peace by offering it something.*

*But what?*

*It hasn't been outside that room for weeks, maybe it wants food.*

*But the food is back down the hallway…*

*Oh, no.*

I stare down the hallway as I try to mentally prepare for going back.

*You can do it, Fluttershy.*

I ran down the hallway… and tripped, landing right in front of the door.

*No, no, no, no, no, no!*

I rush away, hooves slipping on the floor as my vision blurs.

I make it to the bottom of the stairs, collapsing on the floor.

I hear it bash itself against the door over and over, each time I curl up into a tighter ball.

My vision goes black as I whimper to myself, tears streaking to the floor.

The thought of the door opening won't leave my mind, making my world shake and spin.

My vision comes back as I calm down, still too afraid to look up.

I lay there for an unknown amount of time, losing all sense of time.

Eventually, I lift my head, shaking profusely. Looking around, I see I am alright, for now…

I sit up, remembering what I was doing.

*Oh, yea, food offering.*

I get up and slowly walk upstairs, as if making a noise will release *it*.

I make it to the fridge and open it.

With shaky hooves, I pull out the few remaining carrots I have left.

*These probably won't be enough.*

*It'll have to do for now.*

I make my way back downstairs even slower than I came up.

At the bottom of the stairs, I just stand there staring at the door, thinking of how I will be able to force myself to do this.

*I have to try…*

I lay down on the floor, belly first. Holding the carrots in my mouth, I inch my way towards the door.

Every centimeter makes my heart rate go up.

*I'm… I'm… I''m doing it.*

That's when it crashed against the door again.

I close my eyes and resolve to continue as my body shivers.

*I can't live in fear…*

*I must.*

Tears flow from my eyes and I can feel my hoof bump into the door frame.

*Here goes nothing…*

I take a carrot in my hooves, almost dropping it several times.

I shakily stick it under the door as I can feel another panic attack coming on.

I shove as many carrots under the door as I can with my eyes closed before I scamper away, leaving all the carrots at the door.

I make it to the stairs again before I pass out.

I wake up and open my eyes. The room is far darker than before.

*How long was I out?*

I look instinctively at the door.

*All the carrots are gone…*

Looking close, I see scratch marks on the floor.

*It's never done that before…*

I hyperventilate, my vision blurring again.

*Don't pass out again.*

*Don't.*

Thankfully I don't pass out, I do collapse to the floor though, audibly whimpering.

*What do I do now?*

*I think it ate all the carrots. Do I feed it something else?*

I clench my pain and stand up.

*I have to try, again…*

I clamber up the stairs and back to the fridge. I open it and pull out two apples.

I set them on the counter and cut them in half.

*Should fit under the door now.*

I meander down the stairs before deciding to take a different approach.

*I might be able to slide them under the door from afar.*

I crawl within two feet of the door, hunkering down.

*Here goes nothing.*

I flick the first half of an apple towards the door as *it* bashes against the door again.

I curl up before I start to shake.

*Be brave.*

*You can do this.*

I look up and see the half is nowhere to be seen.

Steeling my nerves, I flick the second half.

This one I watched go under the door.

It doesn't react, so I send the third one.

The third one gets stuck under the door. I watch it for a split second, before it disappears into that room.

I send the fourth one, then back off from the door.

Looking back, I see it's also gone.

It starts crashing into the door over and over, harder than ever before.

*I need to get to the other side, it's safer over there.*

I stand up and stretch my legs as tears stream down my face.

I charge down the hallway with my eyes closed, too afraid to open them.
