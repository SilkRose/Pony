# The Pink Tax

I look up from my desk as I hear somepony enter my room in a rush.

Pinkie frantically shuts the door. "Starlight, have you paid your taxes?"

"No, what are you talking about?"

Pinkie walks over to my desk. "The Pink Tax, it's a tax on pink ponies."

"That's ridiculous, are you sure it's real?"

"Yes, and I'm not paying this year!"

"How are you going to do that?"

"I don't know yet."

"Why pink?"

"It's the most common color, coat, mane, tails, cutie mark, it's everywhere."

"That seems crazy, like putting a tax on being cute."

"Don't give them ideas! That would ruin Fluttershy."

As if on cue, Fluttershy entered Starlight's office.

"Hello, is this where I pay my taxes?"

Pinkie says, "No, but you should skip paying with me!"

"I couldn't do that, I want to be a good citizen."

I ask, "Doesn't it seem a bit colorist to single out pink?"

Fluttershy says, "Well, I guess so."

Pinkie exclaims, "Exactly."

Before anypony could speak, another pony entered the room, Twilight.

Pinkie asked, "Don't tell me you're here to pay the pink tax."

"I am, is this the right spot?"

"There's barely any pink on you."

"I only pay every three years, this year I was up."

Pinkie drops her head, face planting the desk.

Pinkie lifts her head. "I am not paying."

Twilight contests, "That's illegal."

"I'll find a way."

A fourth pony enters the room, Sweetie Drops.

"I'm here to pay my pink tax, this must be the right place."

Pinkie says annoyed, "Why is everypony okay with this?"

Everypony shrugged.

Pinkie says, "Join me, evade the pink tax, send them a message."

Nopony seemed to care.

Diamond Tiara enters the room amidst the silence.

Pinkie is outraged. "They're taxing children now! How can you stand for this?"

Diamond Tiara says, "So, this is the right place."

Pinkie asks, "Isn't your father the tax collector?"

"Yes, he's probably on his way now."

Pinkie sighs before the Cutie Mark Crusaders enter the room.

Pinkie asks, "Pink Tax?"

Sweetie Belle answers, "Yes, this is it, girls."

"How? I understand you, but Scootaloo and Applebloom, they're not pink!"

The two mentioned fillies show their cutie marks, pointing to the tiny pink spots.

Pinkie is in disbelief. "Seriously? You have to pay for that?"

Twilight interjects, "I wonder if Shinning has to pay? He has a small pink star on his cutie mark."
