# The Pink Tax

Starlight looks up from her desk as she hears somepony enter her room in a rush.

Pinkie frantically shuts the door. "Starlight, have you paid your taxes?"

"No, what are you talking about?"

Pinkie walks over to Starlight's desk. "The Pink Tax, it's a tax on pink ponies."

"That's ridiculous, are you sure it's real?"

"Yes, and I'm not paying this year!"

"How are you going to do that?"

"I don't know yet."

"Why pink?"

"It's the most common color, coat, mane, tails, cutie mark, it's everywhere."

"That seems crazy, like putting a tax on being cute."

"Don't give them ideas! That would ruin Fluttershy."

As if on cue, Fluttershy entered Starlight's office.

"Hello, is this where I pay my taxes?"

Pinkie says, "No, but you should skip paying with me!"

"I couldn't do that, I want to be a good citizen."

Starlight asks, "Doesn't it seem a bit colorist to single out pink?"

Fluttershy says, "Well, I guess so."

Pinkie exclaims, "Exactly."

Before anypony could speak, another pony entered the room, Twilight.

Pinkie asked, "Don't tell me you're here to pay the pink tax."

"I am, is this the right spot?"

"There's barely any pink on you."

"I only pay every three years, this year I was up."

Pinkie drops her head, face planting the desk.

Pinkie lifts her head. "I am not paying."

Twilight contests, "That's illegal."

"I'll find a way."

A fourth pony enters the room, Sweetie Drops.

"I'm here to pay my pink tax, this must be the right place."

Pinkie says annoyed, "Why is everypony okay with this?"

Everypony shrugged.

Pinkie says, "Join me, evade the pink tax, send them a message."

Nopony seemed to care.

Diamond Tiara enters the room amidst the silence.

Pinkie is outraged. "They're taxing children now! How can you stand for this?"

Diamond Tiara says, "So, this is the right place."

Pinkie asks, "Isn't your father the tax collector?"

"Yes, he's probably on his way now."

Pinkie sighs before the Cutie Mark Crusaders enter the room.

Pinkie asks, "Pink Tax?"

Sweetie Belle answers, "Yes, this is it, girls."

"How? I understand you, but Scootaloo and Applebloom, they're not pink!"

The two mentioned fillies show their cutie marks, pointing to the tiny pink spots.

Pinkie is in disbelief. "Seriously? You have to pay for that?"

The room went silent as Pinkie looked around the room. "What about Mayor Mare, where is she? She has a pink mane."

Sweetie Belle spoke up, "I think she doesn't have to pay because she dyes her mane gray."

Pinkie bemoans, "That't not fair, I can't dye my entire coat!"

Twilight ponders aloud, "I wonder if Shinning has to pay? He has a small pink star on his cutie mark."

Moments later, he walked in the room, along with Cadence and Flurry Heart.

Twilight asked, "Do you all have to pay the tax too?"

Cadence answered, "Yes, it's nice to see you again."

Twilight and Cadence did their special dance.

Pinkie says, "I can't believe this, the princesses of love and friendship have to pay a tax for having pink on them."

Twilight just shrugged. "It's the law."

Pinkie drops her head on the desk in disbelief. "Who's next, Celestia?"

It was. Celestia came into the room as the whole room bowed in her presence.

Pinkie's mouth hung open is shock.

Pinkie spoke, "No, no, no, no, no. There is no way you have to pay the pink tax."

Celestia spoke, "Ah, so this is the right place."

"This doesn't make any sense," Pinkie said.

Twilight asked, "Celestia, why do you have to pay, isn't it your law?"

Celestia chuckled. "No, Luna created the law."

Twilight asked, "Why?"

"Over a thousand years ago, Luna and I got into an argument over something silly, she decided to make a law to spite me."

Pinkie interjected, "Why haven't you removed it?"

Celestia lamented, "I left it as a memento while she was gone."

Pinkie asked, "Well, could you remove it?"

"I suppose I could, since she's returned, there is no need for the law. I would have to wait till next year to remove it, this tax season has already begun. So, I'm afraid we will have to pay for one more year."

Pinkie sits in thought for a moment before a devious grin spread on her face. "Maybe not."

Filthy Rich opened the door to Starlight Glimmer's office, walking inside, he closes the door behind him.

Looking around the room, he finds a single pink alicorn sitting in the middle of the room.

"Pink Tax?" the pink alicorn said, perturbed.

"Yes, shouldn't there be more ponies?"

"They aren't pink anymore."

"How?"

"They all dyed their coats, mane, and tails."

"What about you?"

"I'm Princess Lunaâ€¦ they died me pink."

"Oh, well, that'll be fifty bits, ma'am."
