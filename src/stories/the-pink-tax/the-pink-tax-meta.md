## Short Description
Tax season is almost over, and Pinkie hasn't paid hers yet.

## Ideas
- Pinkie goes to starlight, trying to get help to evade the pink tax.
- The entire story takes place in Starlight office.
- Starlight doesn't know about the tax, thinking it makes no sense.
- More and more pink ponies show up, thinking this is where they pay the tax.
- Pinkie can't believe everyone is so willing to pay.
- By the end, Pinkie is surprised the mayor isn't there, since her mane is pink naturally.
- Somepony mentions that she doesn't pay because she dyes her hair.
- Pinkie thinks of a genius scheme.
- The tax collector is Filthy Rich.
- When the tax collector shows up to collect, everypony is now a different color, no pink in sight.
