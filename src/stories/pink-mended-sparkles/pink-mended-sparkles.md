# Pink-Mended Sparkles

I turn away from the blinding light, staring at Pinkie.

"Twilight," Pinkie yells.

I hit the floor, hard.

I see Pinkie jump to me, kneeling to hold me.

Her cries get farther and farther as I stare at her.

I try to speak, but nothing comes out as my vision goes black.

The last thing I remember is, *Pinkie.*

***

I wake up, hearing the sound of a sterile heart rate monitor.

I try to open my eyes, and can't. I turn my head left and right.

*Why can't I see?*

"Twilight, you're awake!" Pinkie says.

*Pinkie?*

"Pinkie… what happened?"

"You passed out on the floor, I carried you here as fast as I could."

"I'm… in a hospital, right?"

*Hopefully.*

"Yes."

"Why can't I see?"

"The doctors said the spell temporally blinded you."

"How long in temporary?"

"They said it could be anywhere from days to weeks."

*Oh, great.*

As I lay there, I realize Pinkie has been hugging me this entire time.

I return the hug. "Thank you."

Pinkie hugs me tighter. "You're welcome."

"How long have I been out?"

"A few hours."

"Did they say whether I'm staying here or if I can go home?"

"They said you can go home if somepony is there to help you. I volunteered."

"You didn't have to do that."

"I wanted to… this is my fault after all." Pinkie stops hugging me.

*Don't leave.*

I feel colder without her embrace. "It was my fault… I should have been more prepared."

Pinkie doesn't respond.

"Pinkie?"

"Yes?"

"Can you hold my hoof?"
