## Short Description
When a spell leaves Twilight blinded, Pinkie is left to take care of her while her feelings for her blossom.

## Ideas
- Twilight says to Pinkie, "There is one thing I want from you before I can see again, a kiss." Pinkie kisses Twi and as they kiss, Twilight removes the bandages over her eyes with magic.
- Pinkie has her eyes closed and opens them, staring into Twilight's eyes as they kiss.
- Pinkie is relieved after the kiss, glad she doesn't have to pretend to not have feelings, casually mentions that she has blushed almost as much as Twilight had, or something like that.
