## Chapters
[Chapter 1: Pink Reflection](./01-pink-reflection.md)
- Starts with Pinkie, bouncing as usual, in her room above Sugarcube Corner.
- Maybe she is planning her next party and going through the checklist, or maybe she is going over a list of her pinkie promises for the next day. (she will go through each item individually.)
- After that, her final item on that list is to check on her smile.
- She goes to the mirror and puts her biggest smile.
- Her reflection stares back sadly, mane flat and colors dull.

> Pinkie: Come onnn now! I gotta get this smile big and bright for tomorrow! You know the drill! Reflection: …you can't keep doing this Pinkie. You can't keep lying to yourself like this.

- They go back and forth, reflection brings up her fears and anxieties that always plague her, worries that never go away, etc.
- Pinkie consistently denies or defends it.

> Pinkie: That… doesn't matter, I- I have to keep smiling, otherwise how can I make other ponies smile? Reflection: But what about you? About me? Don't we matter too? Pinkie: I do matter! But it's worth it to make other ponies smile. Reflection: But look what it's done to you! You can't even recognize your own reflection! (or something to tie in the description)

- They continue back and forth some more, and eventually the reflection gives up, tired.
- Pinkie acts satisfied and goes something like, "alright, one more time!" She tries on a big grin in the mirror.
- Her own poofy-maned, bright-colored self smiles back, and Pinkie nods in satisfaction, wiping away a single tear in the corner of her eye before leaving.

[Chapter 2: Pink Refraction](./02-pink-refraction.md)
- Starts with Pinkie helping someone (mane 6, or Zecora, or anyone) in the Everfree forest, and accidentally brushes against poison joke.
- From there, that night, she does the same thing as the first part, but this time loses her temper and smashes the mirror. She goes to sleep and doesn't notice her reflection is missing from the fallen pieces of mirror.
- The next day, each of the mane 6 are visited by pinkie's depressed reflection, who talks with each of them about one instance when pinkie pretended to be happy to make them happy, and also reveals something's about her worries and fears and anxieties. (still to figure out)
- Pinkie cleans up the mirror the next day after helping said friend. She cleans up her broken mirror, realizing she has no reflection.
- Pinkie reasons she just hasn't slept enough, leaving the room happy.

[Chapter 3: Pink Restoration](./03-pink-restoration.md)
- Perspective switches to pinkie who is returning home after hosting a party or something, and is surprised by her friends with a something that assuages all her fears and anxieties
