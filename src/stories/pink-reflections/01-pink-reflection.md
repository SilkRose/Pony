# Pink Reflection

Pinkie Pie bounces up the stairs of Sugarcube Corner to her room, a wide grin plastered on her face. She sighs in satisfaction to herself.

"Another successful party planned! That one was quite a doozy."

Pinkie reaches into her mane and pulls out a long piece of paper.

"Now to check off the last few items on my party plan for today!"

She reads down the list, checking off each item with a flick of a quill held in a strand of her mane.

"Okie! Hold the birthday party for Sweetie Belle? Check! Give Gummy his bath? Check! Clean up the downstairs kitchen? Check! Finish the pre-ordered cakes for pickup tomorrow morning? Check! All that's left, as usual, is…"

Pinkie's eyes linger at the final item at the bottom of the list, one that has remained on every daily list for many, many years now.

*Check on your smile.*

Pinkie's grin briefly wavers. "R- right. Well, okie dokie lokie!"

She bounces her way to the bathroom and flicks on the lights, her eyes settling on the mirror over the nearby sink. She trots over to the mirror and gives her brightest smile.

Her reflection does not smile back.

She smiles wider.

Her reflection does not smile back.

She strains and stretches the tips of her grin as far as she possibly can.

Her reflection does not smile back.

"Come on, can we not do this today, I'm tired."

Her reflection's mane flattens and falls down, the colors across her face and body dulling. Its gaze leaves her own and casts upon the floor.

*"How long do you think you can keep doing this, Pinkie?"*

"I don't know what you mean, I can smile all night if you-"

*"That's not what I mean, and you know it."*

Pinkie rolls her eyes.

"I still don't know what you mean. Sweetie Belle was happy at the party! They all were! They were all smiling and laughing and having a total blast tonight!"

*"And you?"*

"I'm always happy!"

*"Heh. Sure you are."

"My wide smile says so!"

*"The one you put on every morning so nopony ever sees who you really are?"*

Pinkie drops the smile and looks away.

"And what does it matter if I put it on every morning so that's what ponies see instead?"

*"It's everything! All of it!"* Her reflection pleads with her. *"You're making everypony happy, but you're yourself can barely make your true self smile!"* 

"So what?! If wearing a smile brings one to the faces of all my friends and all the ponies of Ponyville, why should I stop?"

*"Pinkie, look at me! Can you even recognize me anymore, your own reflection?"*

Pinkie complies, and winced momentarily. Heavy bags weigh under her tired, reddened eyes, her flat mane cascades down her neck and face, several loose strands sticking out all over. The fur under her eyes is matted from nights of tears. Both ears hang limp to the sides of her face. She squeezes her eyes shut and turns away.

"But I'm fine! I can take it! I love seeing ponies laugh, and if this is what it takes, then I'll do it!"

*"But you're NOT fine! You put on a front for your friends, but deep down you're miserable, deep down you're* me.*"*

"I said I'm fine, I can handle it."

*"Can you? Really? What are you going to do when you can't anymore? When you crash and burn, when your friends see the real you."*

"That won't happen, I won't let it!"

*"But it will! Sooner or later, all of… THIS, that you've kept hidden underneath, will be too much to handle. What then? Please, you can't keep doing this!"*

"No, it won't, you're wrong. I am strong, and I'll never disappoint my friends," Pinkie says as a tear rolls down her face.

*"You know it will, and you're afraid. You've delayed the crash, and you're terrified of the burns."*

"I've delayed it this long, what's a few more years?"

*"You don't have a few more years, you need help, and you need it now!"*

"I don't need nothing from nopony, I just need to make my friends smile."

*"What about those friends? What will you do when you can't make them smile? When you burn out and can't plan the next party, the next celebration?"*

"I haven't run out of ideas yet, and I got a million more in the back of my head, as long as I force myself, I can do anything."

*"What about when forcing yourself stops working? When you see a room and the decorations don't appear in your mind, when your party cannon fails?"*

"I'm not going to fail, and I'm not going to burnout!"

*"What about when you're alone? When you have no friends? Will you care then?"*

"My friends will never abandon me, especially Rainbow Dash."

*"Why bring up Rainbow Dash, still holding out hope she will like you back? Will you get help when she rejects you, when they all do?"*

"They would never do that…"

*"They WILL and are going to if you don't get the help you NEED."*

Pinkie stomps her hooves on the floor and lets out a frustrated huff. "No they won't. We've been over this a million times already."

"Getting angry won't help, you're under too much pressure for that to let off steam."

"I can handle the pressure," Pinkie almost screams.
