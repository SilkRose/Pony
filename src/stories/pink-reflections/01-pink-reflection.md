# Pink Reflection

Pinkie Pie bounces up the stairs of Sugarcube Corner to her room, a wide grin plastered on her face. She sighs in satisfaction to herself.

"Another successful party planned! That one was quite a doozy."

Pinkie reaches into her mane and pulls out a long piece of paper.

"Now to check off the last few items on my party plan for today!"

She reads down the list, checking off each item with a flick of a quill held in a strand of her mane.

"Okie! Hold the birthday party for Sweetie Belle? Check! Give Gummy his bath? Check! Clean up the downstairs kitchen? Check! Finish the pre-ordered cakes for pickup tomorrow morning? Check! All that's left, as usual, isâ€¦"

Pinkie's eyes linger at the final item at the bottom of the list, one that has remained on every daily list for many, many years now.

*Check on your smile.*

Pinkie's grin briefly wavers. "R- right. Well, okie dokie lokie!"

She bounces her way to the bathroom and flicks on the lights, her eyes settling on the mirror over the nearby sink. She trots over to the mirror and gives her brightest smile.

Her reflection does not smile back.

She smiles wider.

Her reflection does not smile back.

She strains and stretches the tips of her grin as far as she possibly can.

Her reflection does not smile back.

"Come on, can we not do this today, I'm tired."

Her reflection's mane flattens and falls down, the colors across her face and body dulling. Its gaze leaves her own and casts upon the floor.

*"How long do you think you can keep doing this, Pinkie?"*

"I don't know what you mean, I can smile all night if you-"

*"That's not what I mean, and you know it."*

Pinkie rolls her eyes.

"I still don't know what you mean. Sweetie Belle was happy at the party! They all were! They were all smiling and laughing and having a total blast tonight!"

*"And you?"*

"I'm always happy!"

*"Heh. Sure you are."

"My wide smile says so!"

*"The one you put on every morning so nopony ever sees who you really are?"*

Pinkie drops the smile and looks away.

"And what does it matter if I put it on every morning so that's what ponies see instead?"

*"It's everything! All of it!"* Her reflection pleads with her. *"You're making everypony happy, but you're yourself can barely make your true self smile!"* 

"So what?! If wearing a smile brings one to the faces of all my friends and all the ponies of Ponyville, why should I stop?"

*"Pinkie, look at me! Can you even recognize me anymore, your own reflection?"*

Pinkie complies, and winced momentarily. Heavy bags weigh under her tired, reddened eyes, her flat mane cascades down her neck and face, several loose strands sticking out all over. The fur under her eyes is matted from nights of tears. Both ears hang limp to the sides of her face. She squeezes her eyes shut and turns away.

"But I'm fine! I can take it! I love seeing ponies laugh, and if this is what it takes, then I'll do it!"

*"But you're NOT fine! You put on a front for your friends, but deep down you're miserable, deep down you're* me.*"*

"I said I'm fine, I can handle it."

*"Can you? Really? What are you going to do when you can't anymore? When you crash and burn, when your friends see the real you."*

"That won't happen, I won't let it!"

*"Your failure is a foregone conclusion, whether you like it or not. Failure is just waiting to collect."*

"No, it won't, you're wrong. I am strong, and I'll never disappoint my friends," Pinkie says as a tear rolls down her face.

*"You know it will, and you're afraid. You've delayed the crash, but you're terrified of the burns."*
