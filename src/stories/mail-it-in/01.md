I walked out of my house onto my front porch to sit on the swing after just finishing unpacking my belongings. I had just moved in yesterday.

As i sit on the swing, the mailmare approaches, a grey pegasus with a blonde mane and yellow eyes that were looking the opposite way.

"Hi, Welcome to Ponyville." She said.

"Hi, thanks for having me, my name is NAME, what's yours?" I said.

"Derpy Hooves, here's your mail."

"Thank you, have a nice day."

Then Derpy leaves.
