### Description

With the help of her friends, can Pinkie plan an amazing date for Rarity? Will she still be able to do it while helping Rainbow deal with her feelings for Fluttershy?

### Short Description
Pinkie Pie and Rarity throw a party to announce their relationship. Pinkie asks Rarity on a date, getting the rest of their friends to help plan it, all while Rarity and Pinkie try to help Fluttershy and Rainbow with their feelings for each other.

### Ideas
- Have sub-plot of Rainbow and Fluttershy liking each other, they ask each other out in an epilogue.
- Each friend helps with one thing:
	- Rainbow Dash - Provides entertainment, an aerial show, with clouds shaped to spell ‘Rarity <3 Pinkie’.
	- Fluttershy - Helps make Rarity a dress for Pinkie to give her.
	- Applejack - Provides the place and sets up the picnic with food for the end of the date.
	- Twilight Sparkle - Provides royal carriage for transportation on the date.
- Rarity and Pinkie also pick something for the date:
	- Rarity - Rarity just wants to spend time with Pinkie.
	- Pinkie - Pinkie wants the same so she comes with the idea of ending the date with a sleepover? And maybe Pinkie sings Rarity a song.
* At the end of the party, Twilight walks with Rarity home, they talk on the way. Rarity is excited about the date, something she says gives Twilight the idea to barrow the royal carriage.
