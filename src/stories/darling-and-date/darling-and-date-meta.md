### Short Description

Pinkie and Rarity throw a party to announce their relationship. Pinkie asks Rarity on a date, getting the rest of their friends to help plan it, all while Rarity and Pinkie try to help Fluttershy and Rainbow deal with their feelings for each other.

### Ideas

- Have sub-plot of Rainbow and Fluttershy liking each other, they ask each other out in an epilogue.
- Each friend helps with one thing:
	- Rainbow Dash - Provides entertainment, an aerial show, with clouds shaped to spell 'Rarity <3 Pinkie', and clears the skies for their date.
	- Fluttershy - Helps make Rarity a dress for Pinkie to give her.
	- Applejack - Provides the place and sets up the picnic with desert for the end of the date.
	- Twilight Sparkle - Provides royal carriage for transportation on the date, and helps time the date for sunset.
- Rarity and Pinkie also pick something for the date:
	- Rarity - Rarity just wants to spend time with Pinkie, so Pinkie asks Rarity if she wants to have a sleepover at the end of the date.
	- Pinkie - Pinkie sings Rarity a song. She picks the game they play. She makes the desert they eat.

#### Dress Design:
White flowing dress, with a purple stitch going all the way around the skirt about one quarter of an inch from the bottom. The front has sleeves that cover one fourth her front legs. The neck has a blue stitch going around with a V neck in the front.
