Pinkie Pie and Rarity throw a party to announce their relationship. Pinkie asks Rarity on a date, getting the rest of their friends to help plan it, all while Rarity and Pinkie try to help Fluttershy and Rainbow with their feelings for each other.

### Ideas
- Have sub-plot of Rainbow and Fluttershy liking each other, they ask each other out in an epilogue.
- Each friend helps with one thing:
	- Applejack - Provides the place and sets up the picnic with food for the end of the date.
	- Fluttershy - Helps make Rarity a dress for Pinkie to give her.
	- Twilight Sparkle - Provides royal carriage for transportation on the date.
	- Rainbow Dash - Provides entertainment, an aerial show, with clouds shaped to spell ‘Rarity <3 Pinkie’.
* At the end of the party, Twilight walks with Rarity home, they talk on the way. Rarity is excited about the date, something she says gives Twilight the idea to barrow the royal carriage.
