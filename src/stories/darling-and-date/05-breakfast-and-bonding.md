# Epilogue: Breakfast and Bonding

Fluttershy stopped pacing in her living room and took a deep breath.

*You can do this Fluttershy.*

Fluttershy walked to her door and opened it, resolving that this was it.

*Rainbow Dash will know today what is in my heart.*

Fluttershy closed the door behind and her started trotting to Rainbow's house.

Fluttershy thought of her crush as she trotted.

*Rainbow said she wanted to show me how much she cares. I sure hope it's love.*

*I sure know I love her.*

Fluttershy decided, *I'm going to ask her out after we eat, I hope she's okay with me going first...*

*Wonder what's for breakfast? Is Rainbow making it?*

*I bet she'd put in a lot of effort if she was cooking.*

*She always goes hard at anything she does.*

*I hope she says yes.*

*I can only imagine what a relationship with her would be like, I bet it'd be fun.*

*All I can do is ask, right?*

*Rarity is right, I'm ready, yes or no, I can handle it.*

*Besides, it's a far shot, but maybe Rainbow has feelings for me too?*

*That sure would surprise her, asking her our right before she was going to ask me out.*

Fluttershy giggle to herself, *probably not, but I hope she gives me a chance...*

Her thoughts changed to how she was going to ask.

*I want to ask her out on the couch if I can, like how I was practicing.*

*I just have to ask, be brave.*

*If she says no, you need to keep it together, don't cry.*

*If she says no, you need to talk it out, like Rarity said.*

Fluttershy's thoughts ended as she stopped, looking up she saw the cloud home of her crush.

She flew up and stood at the door, giving herself one last pep talk before knocking.

*You got this!*

Moments later Rainbow answered the door with a smile, "hi."

Fluttershy smiled, "Hello, I'm here for breakfast."

"Come on in," Rainbow said as stood aside.

Fluttershy trotted inside, closing the door behind her before following Rainbow into her dinning room.

Rainbow pulled out a chair for Fluttershy.

Fluttershy sat down, "thank you."

"You're welcome," Rainbow said, "I'm going to make us breakfast."

"What are we having?" Fluttershy asked.

*I hope it's pancakes, the ones I ate at Pinkie's the other day were awesome.*

"It's a surprise," Rainbow said with a grin.

"Oh, okay," Fluttershy said.

"I'll be back when it's done," Rainbow said before disappearing into the kitchen.

***

Rainbow trotted into the kitchen, the door closing behind her.

*Why didn't you just say pancakes, it wasn't a secret.*

She shook her head, trying to clear her mind.

*Come on Rainbow, don't blow it now, focus.*

Rainbow went over to her mixing bowl and starting adding the ingredients one at a time, mentally checking them off after adding them.

Flour, *check.*

Baking powder, *check.*

Sugar, *check.*

Salt, *check.*

Rainbow picked up her whisk and began to sift the ingredients as her mind wandered to the mare in the other room.

*I love her.*

*...It's just, does she love me like that?*

*I'll know soon.*

*I hope she does.*

Her thoughts drifted to her desires.

*I just want to hold her.*

*To kiss her.*

*To protect her.*

Her train of thought ended when she looked down and saw she was done sifting.

She shook her head again, trying to clear away the intense blush that had formed.

*You'll never have the chance to kiss her if you mess this up. Remember, pancakes.*

Rainbow pressed a hole into the dry mix, and added the wet ingredients, checking them off in her head, again.

Butter, *check.*

Milk, *check.*

Egg, *check.*

Rainbow picked up her whisk again and mixed the ingredients for the last time.

As she mixed, her thoughts again turned to Fluttershy.

*I want to tell her she's the prettiest mare I've ever seen.*

*...and I want her to tell me it back,* she admitted to herself as the idea of Fluttershy calling her pretty brought her blush back in full force.

*I'm willing to be vulnerable for her.*
