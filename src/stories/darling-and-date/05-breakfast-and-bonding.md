# Epilogue: Breakfast and Bonding

Fluttershy stopped pacing in her living room and took a deep breath.

*You can do this Fluttershy.*

Fluttershy walked to her door and opened it, resolving that this was it.

*Rainbow Dash will know today what is in my heart.*

Fluttershy closed the door behind and her started trotting to Rainbow's house.

Fluttershy thought of her crush as she trotted.

*Rainbow said she wanted to show me how much she cares. I sure hope it's love.*

*I sure know I love her.*

Fluttershy decided, *I'm going to ask her out after we eat, I hope she's okay with me going first...*

*Wonder what's for breakfast? Is Rainbow making it?*

*I bet she'd put in a lot of effort if she was cooking.*

*She always goes hard at anything she does.*

*I hope she says yes.*

*I can only imagine what a relationship with her would be like, I bet it'd be fun.*

*All I can do is ask, right?*

*Rarity is right, I'm ready, yes or no, I can handle it.*

*Besides, it's a far shot, but maybe Rainbow has feelings for me too?*

*That sure would surprise her, asking her our right before she was going to ask me out.*

Fluttershy giggle to herself, *probably not, but I hope she gives me a chance...*

Her thoughts changed to how she was going to ask.

*I want to ask her out on the couch if I can, like how I was practicing.*

*I just have to ask, be brave.*

*If she says no, you need to keep it together, don't cry.*

*If she says no, you need to talk it out, like Rarity said.*

Fluttershy's thoughts ended as she stopped, looking up she saw the cloud home of her crush.

She flew up and stood at the door, giving herself one last pep talk before knocking.

*You got this!*

Moments later Rainbow answered the door, "hi."
