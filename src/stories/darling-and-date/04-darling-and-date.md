# Darling and Date

Rarity opened her door, expecting Pinkie Pie, which she found. What she wasn't expecting, was the dress she had on. Pinkie Pie was wearing the dress Rarity gave her when they got together.

"Hello, darling," Rarity said. "I didn't know we were wearing dresses or I would have put one on."

Pinkie said, "Can I come in? I have a gift for you."

"Sure," Rarity said before she stepped aside.

Pinkie entered the shop as Rarity noticed a large flat present on Pinkie's back.

Pinkie sat the present on a modeling pedestal. "This is from Fluttershy and I."

Rarity smiled. "Oh, you didn't have to get me anything."

Pinkie replied, "We didn't have to, but we wanted to."

Rarity slowly opened the present.

*I know Fluttershy wanted to make me a dress, but how could they have made it so fast?*

She lifted the lid and her suspicions were confirmed, they had made her a dress.

Rarity picked the dress up in her magic and inspected it. "This is amazing, it matches your dress so well!"

"Rainbow Dash helped too," Pinkie clarified.

"Thank you so much, I'm going to put it on right now," Rarity said before she went behind her privacy wall and put the dress on.

"You're welcome," Pinkie called out to her.

Rarity trotted back to Pinkie after she had changed.

"You look so pretty!" Pinkie exclaimed.

Rarity blushed and said, "You too, darling."

Pinkie blushed in turn and asked, "You ready to date?"

Rarity giggled. "Yes."

Pinkie led Rarity outside, after which a royal carriage pulled by two royal guards stopped in front of the shop.

Rarity's mouth hung open for a second before she asked, "Is this for us?"

"Yes," Pinkie answered before she gestured for Rarity to enter first.

Rarity smiled as she got in the carriage.

*Pinkie has put so much effort into this. And it's just started.*

Pinkie stepped into the carriage and moments later it took off.

As the carriage moved along, Pinkie offered Rarity her hoof to hold.

Rarity took the offer, holding Pinkie's hoof and nuzzled her cheek, causing her to blush.
