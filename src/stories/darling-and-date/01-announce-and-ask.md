# Announce & Ask

Rarity stood with Pinkie in the latter’s room, waiting on their friends to show up for the party. The two stood in silence for some time, Pinkie smiling, while Rarity pondered their friend's reaction to their new relationship.

_What if they don’t approve?_

_What if they don’t want to be friends with us anymore?_

Thinking about it made Rarity fidget slightly, she hoped pinkie hadn't noticed.

She had.

“Rarity, are you alright?” Pinkie asked, head tilting slightly.

Rarity responded, “yes, just a little nervous, darling.”

Pinkie asked, “why? It’ll be fine, our friends will be nothing but supportive!”

Rarity smiled, “yes, I know, but it still makes me a little nervous thinking about it.”

Pinkie hugged her, “Everything will be fine, they’ll all be super supportive and excited for us.”

Rarity smiled in the hug, replying, “You’re right, thank you darling.”

After the hug was over, their first guests knocked on Pinkie’s door. Pinkie hopped over to the door and opened it to reveal Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy.

They walked in and Pinkie closed the door behind them. Pinkie walked over to them and gave each a welcome hug, both pegasi returning the hug in kind.

After the exchange of hugs had completed, Rainbow asked, “What’s this party for? Anything special?”

Rarity, letting her nerves get to her, gulped, not knowing what Pinkie was going to say, luckily she had an answer.

Pinkie replied, “You’ll see when everypony gets here, it's a secret.”

Rainbow replied, “Okay, sounds exciting,” she turned to Rarity and asked, “does this secret involve you or is it a Pinkie thing?”

Before Rarity could think of a reply, somepony knocked on Pinkie’s door. _Thank Celestia._

Everypony turned to the door as Pinkie trotted to the door and opened it, revealing Applejack.

Applejack trotted into the room, Pinkie closing the door behind her. She soon found herself the recipient of a Pinkie Pie hug, and returned it.

After the hug was over, Pinkie said, “once Twilight gets here, we can get this party started.”

As if on cue, somepony knocked on Pinkie’s door, Pinkie went and opened it, revealing their final guest, Twilight.

“Everypony is here,” Pinkie said excitedly as she led Twilight into the room, closing the door behind them.

Pinkie hugged Twilight, who returned it.

Pinkie walked over to Rarity, about to make their big announcement, when she noticed something was up with Rarity. She leaned close to Rarity, hearing her fast breath and seeing her nervous micro-fidgets.

Pinkie puts her hoof around Rarity, pulling her close.

_We can do this, together, _Rarity thought as she loosened up and smiled in the embrace.

Pinkie whispers, “are you okay? We don't have to do this if you don't want to.”

Rarity whispers back, “I am now, let’s do this.”

The two turned to the rest of their friends, who looked confused as to what was going on.

Pinkie explained, “me and Rarity are together,” then smiled, happy to share the news.

Immediately, the two ponies are showered in congratulations and cheers, their friends excited for them. Their smiles grew as a group hug forms, both ponies feeling accepted and loved.

After the hug was over, Pinkie let go of Rarity; excitedly exclaiming, “let’s get this party started!” as she hopped over to a turntable, pressing the start button; a second later, music started playing.

Pinkie started dancing, a few of her friends deciding to join her. Twilight stayed with Rarity, keeping her company.

“Exciting news, I’m happy for you two,” Twilight said.

“Thanks Twilight, it means a lot to me. Pinkie helped calm my nerves, I was letting my thoughts get away from me, I’m sorry,” Rarity replied.

“Happens to us all, don’t worry about it” Twilight replied; hugging Rarity.

Rarity returned the hug, smiling.

Pinkie Pie stopped dancing, wanting a break. She walked over to the food table to grab a drink. She pours herself some punch, turning back towards her friends, she noticed Rainbow had followed her.

Rainbow poured her own drink, then turned to Pinkie, saying, “Congratulations, you guys are cool together.”

Pinkie replied, “Thanks,” then took a drink of her punch.

Pinkie notices Rainbow’s eye dart towards the rest of their friends, then back to her.

Rainbow, in a hushed tone, asked, “Who asked first? Did you both have feelings for each-other?”

Pinkie Pie, taking the hint, replied in a hushed tone, “Technically me, but she was about to ask too. And yes.”

Rainbow asked another question, “How long did you wait before you asked her out?”

Pinkie replied, “A few weeks, but at the end, it was hard not to just blurt it out and kiss her then and there.”

Rainbow muttered under her breath, “Tell me about it…” as her eyes flashed to their yellow pegasus friend.

Pinkie, not quite hearing it, asked, “What was that?”

Rainbow quickly replied, “I mean.. Uh.. I have one last question, have you guys went on a date yet?”

Pinkie Pie replied, “No, not yet,” as gears in her head started turning, “but I'm going to change that soon.”

Rainbow replied, “Ok.”

Pinkie Pie, mind now in full motion, thinking about how she was going to plan their first date, asked Rainbow, “Can you help me?”

Rainbow answered, “Sure, with what?”

Pinkie replied, “The date, silly.”

Rainbow, while look at Fluttershy, replied, “Ok, but I'm not the best at this sort of stuff.”

Pinkie hugged Rainbow, “Thank you.”

After the hug, Pinkie looked over at Rarity, seeing those blue eyes staring back.

Rainbow fallowed her gaze, seeing the pair’s locked eyes.

“Pinkie, go ask her to dance,” Rainbow said, then she went over to the turntable.

“Okay,” Pinkie said, starting for Rarity.

<center>***</center>

Rarity found herself staring at Pinkie from across the room, watching her whisper back and forth with Rainbow Dash.

_Wonder what they’re talking about?_

“Rarity,” Twilight tried to get her attention.

_Maybe they’re planning something?_

“Rarity,” She tried again.

_Pinkie sure is cute when she’s being sneaky._

Finally, Rarity noticed Twilight, who poked her with a hoof.

“Sorry darling, I was a little distracted,” She answered.

“It’s okay, what were you looking at?” Twilight asked.

“Take a guess,” Rarity replied with a slight blush.

“Go,” Twilight said.

“Beg your pardon,” Rarity replied, a little confused.

“Go be with her, if you're distracted by her, you should probably be with her,” Twilight said.

“Thanks Twilight,” Rarity said before giving her a hug, “you’re right.”

After the hug, Rarity noticed Pinkie was on her way to her, deciding to meet her halfway, Rarity walked towards her.

The pair met in the middle of the room, staring at each other before Pinkie speaks.

“Hey,”

“Hello,” Rarity replied.

Catching Rarity off guard, Pinkie asked, “Care for a dance?” as somepony changed the music, playing to a slow song, perfect for a waltz type of dance.

_Does Pinkie know how to waltz?_

Stopping herself from embarrassing herself, she answered, “yes.”

The two ponies came together, holding each other close, and started dancing.

As they danced, Rarity couldn't help but smile. _Of course Pinkie knows how to waltz._

Rarity looked around as they danced in circles, looking at the smiling faces of their friends. _How could I have ever thought these ponies would be anything but supportive. I have the best friends a pony could ask for._

She held Pinkie closer in the dance, sneaking a peck on her cheek, causing Pinkie to blush a little.

After the song was over, they stopped dancing. Standing in the middle of the room, staring into each other's eyes, Rarity thought, _This day can’t get any better._

And then it did.

“Rarity, would you want to go on a date with me?” Pinkie asked.

Rarity, not having any qualms about her friends seeing, kissed Pinkie, holding her close.

Pinkie returned the kiss.

Their friends all watched the pair share such an intimate moment.

Out of the corner of her eye, Rarity noticed Rainbow Dash putting her wing around Fluttershy, holding her close as they sat together.

Rarity had no time to think about it, as their kiss ended and her and Pinkie stared into each other's eyes.

“Is that a yes?” Pinkie asked a little bashfully.

Rarity, blushing slightly, replied, “yes.”

Fluttershy cheered for her friends, causing the pair to notice their friends watching, they turned to them and smiled.

Rarity looked at Fluttershy cheering for them, happy to have such a supportive friend. Changing her gaze to Rainbow, she saw Rainbow staring back at her, before looked at Fluttershy in her wing, then tensing up.

_Are those two together? Why does Rainbow look so tense all of a sudden?_

She didn't have long to ponder, as Rainbow quietly removed her wing from around Fluttershy, who, by Rarity’s best guess, hadn’t noticed the wing at all.

A few seconds later, Fluttershy stood up and trotted over to the refreshments table and started getting herself a glass of punch.

This made Rarity realize how parched she was, saying, “excuse me,” as she followed Fluttershy and got a drink.

Taking a drink of her punch, Rarity looked at Fluttershy, seeing her hiding behind her mane more than usual, eyes staring at her glass of punch.

“Fluttershy, are you alright?” Rarity asked in a concerned tone.

Fluttershy took her time answering, as she looked up at Rarity, pondering what to say.

“Can we talk in private?” Fluttershy eventually asked.

“Of course, darling, come with me,” Rarity said as she leaded Fluttershy out of Pinkie’s room.

_What could be wrong, I hope everything is alright._

<center>***</center>

Pinkie Pie decides to go talk to Twilight after Rarity went to get a drink.

“Hi, Twilight,” Pinkie said, as she approached Twilight.

Twilight smiled, and replied, “Hi, Pinkie.”

“Enjoying the party?” Pinkie asked.

“Most definitely,” Twilight answered, “you two go great together.”

“Thank you,” Pinkie said, giving Twilight a hug.

As the hug ended, Rainbow dash walks up to the pair.

Rainbow looks over her shoulder at Fluttershy and Rarity, then speaks to Pinkie, “you should ask our friends for help too, I’m sure they’ll all love to help, besides, I’m not that good at that stuff, so you’ll need more than just me helping.”

Pinkie Pie thought, _That's a great idea._

Looking at Twilight, who had a confused expression on her face, Pinkie asked, “will you help me and Rainbow plan mine and Rairty’s date?”

“Yes,” Twilight said, “I’m not exactly sure how, but I’ll do my best.”

“Thank you,” Pinkie said, smiling.

Twilight had opened her mouth, about to say something, when she was cutoff by the sound of Pinkie’s door closing, causing the trio to look up and see Rarity and Fluttershy were no longer in the room, only Applejack, who was approaching them.

Applejack asked them, “do any of you know where they went, I was about to go talk to them when they up and walked out.”

Twilight, Rainbow, and Pinkie all shook their heads.

“Oh, Applejack, will you help us plan mine and Rairty’s date?” Pinkie asked.

“Sure, I can probably provide something useful,” Applejack answered.

Pinkie hugged applejack, saying, “thanks.”

<center>***</center>

Rarity lead Fluttershy into Pinkie’s upstairs bathroom, closing the door behind them.

Rarity looked at Fluttershy with concern, “Is everything alright, dear?”

Fluttershy answered, “yes, I.. I..”

Rarity could see it on her face, she was having trouble saying it. _Oh, dear._

Rarity sat in front of Fluttershy, putting her hooves around her, holding her in a comforting embrace, “It’s alright darling, I’m here for you, I won’t judge or tell anypony.”

This calmed Fluttershy, as she relaxed into the embrace, sitting with Rarity, holding her back.

Speaking at almost a whisper, Fluttershy said, “I.. have a.. crush on Rainbow Dash..”

Rarity replied, “why, darling, that's wonderful.”

Fluttershy meekly asked, “how?”

Rarity answered, “you know what you want, and are wiling to share that with me. You can work towards your goal, and I can help you.”

Fluttershy, in a more hopeful tone, asked, “how can you help?”

Rarity answered, “I can help you build courage, you can pretend I’m Rainbow and ask me out.”

“You think it will work?” Fluttershy asked.

“It’s worth a shot, isn’t it, you’ll never ask her out if you don’t try,” Rarity answered, “besides, maybe she likes you and will ask you out first, that’s how it happened to me and Pinkie. I made her a cute dress, saying it was for a client, then I was about to ask her out and give her the dress, when she said she wanted to say something, and asked me out first.”

“You really think she might like me already?” Fluttershy asked.

“Didn’t I see her wing around you earlier tonight?” Rarity asked.

“Well yes, she put her wing around me and I leaned into it, then she tensed up and removed her wing, I don’t know what I did wrong, I thought..” Fluttershy trailed off.

“I think she removed her wing because of me, I was looking at her when she tensed up, she’s probably just self-conscious about being affectionate in public, you know Rainbow,” Rarity said.

Fluttershy asked, “you really think I can ask her out?”

“Yes, I believe in you,” Rarity replied.

Fluttershy in a determined tone, asked, “when can we practice?”

“How about tomorrow, we probably shouldn’t spend all night in Pinkie’s bathroom, they’ll probably wonder where we went,” Rarity answered.

“Sounds good,” Fluttershy said, “and Rarity?”

“Yes, darling,” Rarity replied.

“Thank you,” Fluttershy said, holding Rarity a bit tighter.

“You’re most welcome,” Rarity said, hugging back.

<center>***</center>

Pinkie looked up when she heard her door open, turning to look, she saw Rarity followed by Fluttershy returning to her room. The pair split, Rarity walked up to Rainbow and Applejack, while Fluttershy walked to Twilight and Pinkie.

“Welcome back,” Pinkie said excitedly to Fluttershy, giving her a hug.

“Thanks Pinkie,” Fluttershy said, returning the hug.

“Hey, Fluttershy, can you help me plan my date with Rarity? I already asked everypony else, well, except Rarity, probably shouldn’t ask,” Pinkie said.

“Oh, um, sure,” Fluttershy answered.

“Thank you!” Pinkie said.

Twilight was about to say something, when Rarity walked up to the trio.

“Pinkie, I hate to leave so early, but it’s getting late, and I need to make dinner for Sweetie Belle,” Rarity said.

“That’s fine, the party was great!” Pinkie said, then giving Rarity a big hug, “love you.”

Rarity returned the hug, “love you too.” After the hug, Rarity said, “goodbye, Twilight, Fluttershy, I’ll see you later.”

Fluttershy replied, “bye, Rarity, see you tomorrow.”

Twilight replied, “I’ll walk with you, Rarity, I was going to leave soon, anyway.”

Rarity said, “ok, darling.”

Twilight said, “goodbye girls, see you next time.”

Pinkie said, “goodbye,” as she hugged Twilight.

Fluttershy hugged Twilight after her previous hug was over, saying, “goodbye, Twilight.”

Twilight and Rarity walked away from Pinkie and Fluttershy, towards Rainbow and Applejack, exchanging goodbyes and hugs with the two.

Once the pair reached Pinkie’s door, Rarity turned back, looking at Pinkie she blew her a kiss before smiling at her.

Pinkie caught the kiss and smiled at Rarity as a slight blush formed on both their faces.

After the exchange was over, Twilight and Rarity walked out of Pinkie’s room, closing the door behind them.

Soon after, Applejack and Rainbow walked over to Pinkie and Fluttershy.

“I’ve got to get goin’ too, sugar cube, I’ve got a few chores around the farm that need doin’ before the day's end,” Applejack said.

Pinkie hugged Applejack, saying, “It’s okay, thanks for coming.”

Applejack returned the hug, once over, Applejack turned to Fluttershy, asking, “do you want to walk with me, seeing as your cottage is close to the farm.”

“Sure,” Fluttershy said, then turning to Pinkie, “goodbye Pinkie, it was a great party.”

Pinkie hugged Fluttershy, “thanks, bye.”

Turning to Rainbow, Fluttershy asked, “are you coming with us? I know we came together..” trailing off at the end.

“Sure, but I’ll catch up, I’m going to stay a bit longer and help clean up,” Rainbow said.

“Okay,” Fluttershy said.

With that, Applejack and Fluttershy turned, walking to the door. The pair quietly left, Fluttershy turning to look back at Rainbow before closing the door behind her.

After they had left, Pinkie turned to Rainbow, “thank you for helping clean up,” then giving her a hug.

Rainbow returned the hug, “you’re welcome, but I also wanted to talk while we clean?”

“Sure, what's up?” Pinkie asked.

Rainbow started cleaning up some streamers, taking a second to respond, “don’t tell anypony, okay?”

“You have my Pinkie promise,” Pinkie said as she did the motions.

Rainbow looked at Pinkie, quietly saying, “I.. have a crush on.. Fluttershy.”

Pinkie, overwhelmed with excitement at the news, bounced over to Rainbow and gave her a big hug, exclaiming, "This is so amazing!"

Rainbow, expecting this reaction, laughed a bit, "Slow down their Pinkie," then returned the hug, "I have more to say."

Pinkie let go of the hug and looked at Rainbow with a smile, awaiting her continuance.

Rainbow continued, “I wanted to ask you more about your and Rarity’s relationship and how it started, just so that I’m more prepared in case me and Fluttershy start dating.”

Pinkie replied, “ok, ask away,” as she started cleaning up.

“How did you work up the courage to ask her? Not that I’m having any trouble with that,” Rainbow said, a tinge of nervousness in her voice on the later half.

Pinkie answered, “for a long time, I couldn’t do it, I would be hanging out with her and wanting to ask, but just unable to ask. It went on like that for too long, eventually I just said today was the day and did it. After all, it's just a question same as any other.”

Rainbow said, “okay.”

Pinkie continued, “besides, I know you can do it, I believe in you Dashie!”

Rainbow replied, “thanks, Pinkie.”

Pinkie asked, “any other questions?”

“Yes, what do I say?” Rainbow asked, a bit bashfully, averting her gaze to hide a blush.

“Just be honest with her, tell her how you feel, maybe she secretly has a crush on you and just hasn’t asked because she's you know, shy. I had no idea Rarity liked me until after I asked her out,” Pinkie answered as she started cleaning again.

“Wow, that’s surprising good advice, thanks Pinkie,” Rainbow said.

“You’re welcome,” Pinkie said, picking up the last of the ribbon from the ground.

"What made you want to date Rarity?" Rainbow asked.

"Well, at first, I didn’t realize I liked her, I just wanted to spend more time around her, started noticing her perfume more, savoring her hugs. Once I realized I had a crush I noticed more, I was more giddy in her presence, I liked how she was generous and tries to make ponies smile. I really like her sparkle, as a pony from the far distant future might say. And she is super-duper pretty,” Pinkie answered.

“That's awesome, I’m glad you two got together,” Rainbow replied.

“Thanks,” Pinkie said, smiling as she worked.

“Last question, I swear, did you know she had feelings for you before you asked her out?” Rainbow asked.

“At the time, I had suspicions, but I didn’t know if they were real or just me wanting them to be. The only way to know is to ask. Now, looking back, I can easily tell they were real, they way she smiled at me changed, it was more radiant. She wanted to do more stuff together. I’d catch her staring, then looking away when I noticed. She even started blushing around me, rarely.

“Thanks, Pinkie, you’ve helped me a lot and given me a lot to think about,” Rainbow said.

“You’re welcome,” Pinkie replied.

They continued to clean for a bit before Pinkie broke the silence.

“Do you think Fluttershy likes you?” Pinkie asked.

Rainbow thought for a moment before answering, eventually saying, “I don’t know, sometimes I think she does and others I don’t. At this party while you two danced I was distracted and put my wing around her, at first she leaned into it, I thought that was a sign, but then she went real quick to get a drink and left the room with Rarity.”

Pinkie responded, “maybe you should ask Rarity what they did, they could have been just using the bathroom.”

Rainbow said, “but why would they go together.”

Pinkie thought for a second, “hmm, maybe Rarity needed help with something and wanted to ask for help in private.”

Rainbow replied, “I’m going to ask Rarity tomorrow.”

Pinkie said, ”okie-dokie-lokie.”

Rainbow put away the last of the balloons into Pinkie’s cabinet, then turns to Pinkie saying, “That’s almost all the decorations cleaned up, I’m going to head out, so I can catch up to Fluttershy and Applejack before they get home.”

“Okay, thanks for the help,” Pinkie said as she walked to Rainbow and hugged her.

Returning the hug, Rainbow said, “goodbye.”

Pinkie replied, “goodbye.”

After the hug was over, Rainbow flew out of Pinkies window, eager to see her crush.

Pinkie closed the window behind her. Then finished cleaning up the rest of the party, she yawned as she looked around the room, seeing nothing left to pick up. She thought about starting to plan her date, but decided she would be more prepared after a good night's sleep. Going to bed early tonight, Pinkie laid down in her bed. She smiled as she fell asleep thinking of all the possibilities for her date, and the idea of her two friends dating, _I hope everything goes well for them, _she thought as she drifted off to sleep.

<center>***</center>

Rarity closed the door to Pinkie’s room with a smile and a slight blush on her face. She and Twilight walked down the stairs, trotting out of the store, the pair turned towards Rarity’s house.

The pair walked in silence for a moment before Twilight started up a conversation.

“Must be pretty excited about your date?” Twilight asked.

“Yes, very much so, knowing Pinkie, it could be anything,” Rarity answered.

“That's good to hear, I’m sure she will come up with something amazing,” Twilight said.

“I wonder if it will be fancy or casual? Do you think I need a new dress for it? What if I accidentally overdress? Oh, so many possibilities,” Rarity said.

Twilight took a moment to answer, thinking before saying, “I’m sure she will give you notice of what to wear before the date, she’s good at planning.”

“Yes, you’re right, Twilight,” Rarity replied, “how did you like the party?”

“It was good, it didn’t last as long as normal, but what was there was great,” Twilight answered.

“Thanks,” Rarity replied, “we spent a lot of time talking about the best way to tell the news, I was a bit worried about the reactions like I said earlier, but Pinkie always assured me that it would be fine, and she was right.”

“We will never judge you for being who you are, we all love both of you for being yourselves unabashedly,” Twilight said.

“Thanks Twilight,” Rarity said as they stopped in front of her door, she turned to Twilight and gave her a hug, “I probably sound like a broken record with how much I’ve thanked you guys.”

Twilight returned the hug, saying, ”don’t worry about it, we're all here for you and want to be you be happy.”

Letting go of the hug, Rarity said, “goodnight,” as she smiled at Twilight.

Twilight smiled back and said, “goodnight,” a moment later, Twilight started walking towards her home as Rarity opened the door to her boutique.

Rarity trotted in the kitchen, where she found Sweetie Belle coming down the stairs.

Stopping at the bottom of the stairs, Sweetie Belle asked, “how did the party go?”

“It went well. Does mac n’ cheese sound good for dinner? I am somewhat drained from the party, so something easy would be nice,” Rarity asked.

“That sounds delicious,” Sweetie Belle answered.

Rarity began to make the dinner, softly humming to herself with a pang of exhaustion in her voice. She was tired but happy.
