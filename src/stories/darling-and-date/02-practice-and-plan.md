# Practice and Plan

Fluttershy knocked on Rarity's door again, this time a little louder. Getting no answer she sighed as she realized she wan't loud enough. Hanging her head for a second, then opening the door and walking inside.

Looking around the main room, she didn't see Rarity. She tries calling out to her, "Rarity, are you in here?"

Her call was answered, when from the kitchen she heard Rarity, "in here, darling."

Fluttershy walked into the kitchen, seeing Rarity and Sweetie Belle sitting at the table. There wasn't any food on the table so it seems she may have interrupted them, "oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you two."

Rarity replied, "Oh, not at all darling."

Sweetie Belle piped up, "actually Rarity, I wanted to ask you a few questions about relationships, if that's fine?"

Rarity looked at Fluttershy and asked, "you don't mind if we wait a few minutes before we start, do you?"

Fluttershy replied, "no, not at all, do you want me to wait in the other room?"

Rarity was about to say something when Sweetie Belle interrupted, "she can stay."

Rarity looked at Sweetie Belle with a raised eyebrow before turning to Fluttershy, "I guess you can have a seat," as she pulled a chair out with her magic.

Fluttershy sat down and both adult ponies looked at Sweetie Belle expectantly.

Sweetie Belle took a moment before asking, "how do I know if somepony I like, likes me back?"

Rarity answered, "the easiest way is to ask, but there are other signs you can look for."

Fluttershy looked at Rarity, "like what?"

Rarity replied, "behavioral changes are probably the biggest tell. Do they walk closer to you? Are they wanting to spend more time together? Do they stare at you? Are they more shy around you? Are they more intimate with you? There's more but you probably get the idea."

Sweetie Belle asked another question, "you are dating Pinkie Pie, does that mean its fine that I like another filly?"

"Absolutely," Rarity said, "you can like whatever you like, we won't judge you for being you."

"Thank you," Sweetie Belle replied, "last question, how do I ask them out?"

Rarity answered, "if you have the willpower a simple 'hey, do you want to go out with me?', but you can also add flair to give it a personal touch."

Sweetie Belle said, "okay."

Rarity continued, "when I was pinning for Pinkie I waited a while before deciding to just ask her, and she ended up beating me to it, maybe that will happen to you too."

Sweetie Belle replied, "Thank you for answering my questions, I'm going to go hang out with her today."

Rarity said, "okay, be safe darling."

Sweetie Belle got down from the table and left the kitchen, then leaving her house.

Rarity turned to Fluttershy and asked, "are you ready to start practice?"

Fluttershy answered, "yes."

"Let's go into the main room, we can sit on the couch for this," Rarity said before walking into the other room.

Fluttershy followed her and sat on the couch, looking at Rarity for guidance.

Rarity explained, "pretend I'm Rainbow Dash and ask me out."

*You can do this*, Fluttershy thought.

Giving it her best shot, Fluttershy opened her mouth... and mouthed the words with nothing coming out.

Rarity said, "well, that's a start."

"How do I make the words come out?" Fluttershy asked.

"You've got to make them come out," Rarity said, "your desire to be with Rainbow must be higher than your fear of rejection."

"How is practicing going to help do that?" Fluttershy asked.

"Hopefully its going to lower your fear of rejection, by showing you how it *could* go," Rarity answered, "we will also practice being rejected."

"What do I do now?" Fluttershy asked.

"Keep practicing, even if it is just mouthing the words," Rarity answered.

Fluttershy tried again, still only mouthing the words.

*Come on Fluttershy, you can do this!*

She tried again, same result.

She kept trying again and again, all while Rarity sat there patiently.

Every time she failed, she only wanted to prove she could do it more.

*You got this. You must do this if you want the chance to be with her.*

She tried again, this time making a sound, not even a full word or part of a word, but a sound.

"That's progress, you're doing great," Rarity said.

This made Fluttershy feel better.

*You will ask Rainbow out!*, she thought.

She tried again.

"R..." She managed to say.

Rarity smiled at Fluttershy, "you can do it!"

Fluttershy tried again. "R..." same result.

She tried over and over, each time giving herself a little pep talk before each attempt.

*You can do this, Fluttershy!*

*You will overcome this obstacle!*

*You must be able to do this!*

*You will do it for her.*

Eventually she managed something resembling a word.

"Rain..." Fluttershy said.

Rarity hugged Fluttershy, "you got this, you're doing great darling."

Fluttershy returned the hug, "thank you."
