# Practice and Plan

Fluttershy knocked on Rarity's door again, this time a little louder. Getting no answer she sighed as she realized she wan't loud enough. Hanging her head for a second, then opening the door and walking inside.

Looking around the main room, she didn't see Rarity. She tries calling out to her, "Rarity, are you in here?"

Her call was answered, when from the kitchen she heard Rarity, "in here, darling."

Fluttershy walked into the kitchen, seeing Rarity and Sweetie Belle sitting at the table. There wasn't any food on the table so it seems she may have interrupted them, "oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you two."

Rarity replied, "Oh, not at all darling."

Sweetie Belle piped up, "actually Rarity, I wanted to ask you a few questions about relationships, if that's fine?"

Rarity looked at Fluttershy and asked, "you don't mind if we wait a few minutes before we start, do you?"

Fluttershy replied, "no, not at all, do you want me to wait in the other room?"

Rarity was about to say something when Sweetie Belle interrupted, "she can stay."

Rarity looked at Sweetie Belle with a raised eyebrow before turning to Fluttershy, "I guess you can have a seat," as she pulled a chair out with her magic.

Fluttershy sat down and both adult ponies looked at Sweetie Belle expectantly.

Sweetie Belle took a moment before asking, "how do I know if somepony I like, likes me back?"

Rarity answered, "the easiest way is to ask, but there are other signs you can look for."

Fluttershy looked at Rarity, "like what?"

Rarity replied, "behavioral changes are probably the biggest tell. Do they walk closer to you? Are they wanting to spend more time together? Do they stare at you? Are they more shy around you? Are they more intimate with you? There's more but you probably get the idea."

Sweetie Belle asked another question, "you are dating Pinkie Pie, does that mean its fine that I like another filly?"

"Absolutely," Rarity said, "you can like whatever you like, we won't judge you for being you."

"Thank you," Sweetie Belle replied, "last question, how do I ask them out?"

Rarity answered, "if you have the willpower a simple 'hey, do you want to go out with me?', but you can also add flair to give it a personal touch."

Sweetie Belle said, "okay."

Rarity continued, "when I was pinning for Pinkie I waited a while before deciding to just ask her, and she ended up beating me to it, maybe that will happen to you too."

Sweetie Belle replied, "Thank you for answering my questions, I'm going to go hang out with her today."

Rarity said, "okay, be safe darling."

Sweetie Belle got down from the table and left the kitchen, then leaving her house.

Rarity turned to Fluttershy and asked, "are you ready to start practice?"

Fluttershy answered, "yes."

"Let's go into the main room, we can sit on the couch for this," Rarity said before walking into the other room.

Fluttershy followed her and sat on the couch, looking at Rarity for guidance.

Rarity explained, "pretend I'm Rainbow Dash and ask me out."

*You can do this*, Fluttershy thought.

Giving it her best shot, Fluttershy opened her mouth... and mouthed the words with nothing coming out.

Rarity said, "well, that's a start."

"How do I make the words come out?" Fluttershy asked.

"You've got to make them come out," Rarity said, "your desire to be with Rainbow must be higher than your fear of rejection."

"How is practicing going to help do that?" Fluttershy asked.

"Hopefully its going to lower your fear of rejection, by showing you how it *could* go," Rarity answered, "we will also practice being rejected."

"What do I do now?" Fluttershy asked.

"Keep practicing, even if it is just mouthing the words," Rarity answered.

Fluttershy tried again, still only mouthing the words.

*Come on Fluttershy, you can do this!*

She tried again, same result.

She kept trying again and again, all while Rarity sat there patiently.

Every time she failed, she only wanted to prove she could do it more.

*You got this. You must do this if you want the chance to be with her.*

She tried again, this time making a sound, not even a full word or part of a word, but a sound.

"That's progress, you're doing great," Rarity said.

This made Fluttershy feel better.

*You will ask Rainbow out!*, she thought.

She tried again.

"R..." She managed to say.

Rarity smiled at Fluttershy, "you can do it!"

Fluttershy tried again. "R..." same result.

She tried over and over, each time giving herself a little pep talk before each attempt.

*You can do this, Fluttershy!*

*You will overcome this obstacle!*

*You must be able to do this!*

*You will do it for her.*

Eventually she managed something resembling a word.

"Rain..." Fluttershy said.

Rarity hugged Fluttershy, "you got this, you're doing great darling."

Fluttershy returned the hug, "thank you."

Fluttershy closed her eyes, letting her mind wonder. She thought of the pony she yearned for.

*Oh Rainbow, I wish I could just tell you. Hopefully this practice works.*

Rarity had let go of the hug, but Fluttershy only hugged Rainbow tighter. Rarity just sat there for her friend, letting her have a break.

A few moments later Fluttershy realized she wasn't holding Rainbow Dash, "oh, sorry Rarity."

"Ti's nothing, darling," Rarity answered, "I'm always here for you."

"Thanks," Fluttershy replied.

"Do you want to keep practicing?" Rarity asked.

"Yes," Fluttershy answered with a determined look.

Fluttershy continued to practice, "Rainb..."

She would get so far and then just freeze up, taking her a moment before she could try again.

"Rainb..."

*Come on Fluttershy, you can do this!*

"Rainbo..."

She kept going until she was able to say her full name.

"Rainbow Dash..."

Rarity congratulated Fluttershy on her progress, "you are doing great, darling."

"thank you, Rarity," Fluttershy replied, "your patience and support are really helping."

Fluttershy leaned back on the couch, lowering her shoulders and letting out a tired breath.

Rarity asked, "would you like to take a break darling?"

"Sure," Fluttershy answered, "overcoming social interactions is hard."

"Yes, it took me quite a while before I was able to just ask her out," Rarity said.

"Do, you really think I can do it, Rarity?" Fluttershy asked in a demur tone.

"I know you can," Rarity answered, "I believe in you and will do everything I can to help you ask her out!"

"Thank you, Rarity," Fluttershy said.

After a few seconds of silence Rarity asked, "what made you realize you liked her more than a friend? If you don't mind sharing, of course."

"I feel safest around her," Fluttershy said after a few seconds, "she is always there for me and does things for me even when I know she doesn't want to."

Fluttershy continued, "we have been close friends since childhood, I feel a closeness to her that's hard to explain. When she puts her wing around me, I can barely keep it in, my heart just flutters..."

"don't even get me started on her looks, she's so pretty. How does she look so cool and beautiful at the same time? How am I suppose to get her interested in me? Oh, I want to kiss her so much..."

Fluttershy realized she was rambling, stopped speaking and turned to Rarity.

"Sounds like you love her," Rarity said.

"I do," Fluttershy said.

Rarity replied, "you need to channel you love into asking her out, use it as your determination to ask her out."

Fluttershy said, "I'll try, Rarity."

After a moment of silence Fluttershy asked, "how about you?"

"Beg your pardon?" Rarity asked.

Fluttershy asked, "what made you realize you liked Pinkie romantically?"

Rarity answered, "how she can always makes me smile. She is always doing her best to make everypony smile. Whenever I'm having a bad day, she is always there for me. Even her just being with me makes me feel better."

"Her creativity, if I'm out of ideas for a dress, she tries so hard to help come up with some, sure some of them don't always work, but she gets there in the end."

"She's so pretty, my heart skips a beat just looking at her. Her smile is just so infectious, it's impossible to not smile back at her. Her kisses are like magic, each one makes my head spin and my ears drop."

"I wish we could spend more time together, but we're both very busy mares," Rarity finished.

Fluttershy replied, "you should get your wish when you go on your date."

"Yes, I'm very excited for it, I can't wait to see what Pinkie has planned," Rarity said.

"The idea of going on a date with Rainbow Dash makes me nervous, I would probably ruin it by being too shy," Fluttershy lamented.

"Oh, don't say that, I bet you two would have a lovely time. I do hope she says yes, I'm positive you two would be great together!" Rarity said.

"You really think so?" Fluttershy asked.

"Absolutely darling," Rarity answered.

"Thanks Rarity, I hope so too," Fluttershy said.

"do you want to get back to practicing?" Rarity asked.

Fluttershy answered, "yes."

Rainbow Dash stepped out of her front door, closing it behind her. She took a few steps to the ledge of her houses landing, before falling off and spreading her wings. She flew towards Sugarcube Corner while grappling with her feelings for Fluttershy.

*You've got to ask her out at some point.*

*but what if she says no?* she argued with herself.

*Then accept it, go cry to yourself and move on.*

*I don't want to cry, I want to be with Fluttershy...*

*The only way you will find out if she likes you back is to ask.*

*I know...*

*Why are you putting it off?*

*...I don't want to be vulnerable, I'm supposed to be tough.*

*You are tough, but you of all ponies should know that to get the reward you have to accept the risk, besides, would Fluttershy ever want to hurt you?*

*No.*

*Then when are you going to ask her out?*

Rainbow thought for a moment before deciding.

*After Rarity and Pinkie go on their date, don't want to get in their way of having a good time.*

*Okay, I'm holding you to it.*

*...But you're me?*

Before she could think about it anymore she spotted her destination and started descending down to it. Landing a few steps from the door she trotted into the establishment. She looked around, not seeing Pinkie anywhere she trotted up the stairs and knocked on her door.
