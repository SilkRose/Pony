# Practice and Plan

Fluttershy knocked on Rarity's door again, this time a little louder. Getting no answer she sighed as she realized she wan't loud enough. Hanging her head for a second, then opening the door and walking inside.

Looking around the main room, she didn't see Rarity. She tries calling out to her, "Rarity, are you in here?"

Her call was answered, when from the kitchen she heard Rarity, "in here, darling."

Fluttershy walked into the kitchen, seeing Rarity and Sweetie Belle sitting at the table. There wasn't any food on the table so it seems she may have interrupted them, "oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you two."

Rarity replied, "Oh, not at all darling."

Sweetie Belle piped up, "actually Rarity, I wanted to ask you a few questions about relationships, if that's fine?"

Rarity looked at Fluttershy and asked, "you don't mind if we wait a few minutes before we start, do you?"

Fluttershy replied, "no, not at all, do you want me to wait in the other room?"

Rarity was about to say something when Sweetie Belle interrupted, "she can stay."

Rarity looked at Sweetie Belle with a raised eyebrow before turning to Fluttershy, "I guess you can have a seat," as she pulled a chair out with her magic.

Fluttershy sat down and both adult ponies looked at Sweetie Belle expectantly.

Sweetie Belle took a moment before asking, "how do I know if somepony I like, likes me back?"

Rarity answered, "the easiest way is to ask, but there are other signs you can look for."

Fluttershy looked at Rarity, "like what?"

Rarity replied, "behavioral changes are probably the biggest tell. Do they walk closer to you? Are they wanting to spend more time together? Do they stare at you? Are they more shy around you? Are they more intimate with you? There's more but you probably get the idea."

Sweetie Belle asked another question, "you are dating Pinkie Pie, does that mean its fine that I like another filly?"

"Absolutely," Rarity said, "you can like whatever you like, we won't judge you for being you."

"Thank you," Sweetie Belle replied, "last question, how do I ask them out?"

Rarity answered, "if you have the willpower a simple 'hey, do you want to go out with me?', but you can also add flair to give it a personal touch."

Sweetie Belle said, "okay."

Rarity continued, "when I was pinning for Pinkie I waited a while before deciding to just ask her, and she ended up beating me to it, maybe that will happen to you too."

Sweetie Belle replied, "Thank you for answering my questions, I'm going to go hang out with her today."

Rarity said, "okay, be safe darling."

Sweetie Belle got down from the table and left the kitchen, then leaving her house.

Rarity turned to Fluttershy and asked, "are you ready to start practice?"

Fluttershy answered, "yes."

"Let's go into the main room, we can sit on the couch for this," Rarity said before walking into the other room.

Fluttershy followed her and sat on the couch, looking at Rarity for guidance.

Rarity explained, "pretend I'm Rainbow Dash and ask me out."

*You can do this*, Fluttershy thought.

Giving it her best shot, Fluttershy opened her mouth... and mouthed the words with nothing coming out.

Rarity said, "well, that's a start."

"How do I make the words come out?" Fluttershy asked.

"You've got to make them come out," Rarity said, "your desire to be with Rainbow must be higher than your fear of rejection."

"How is practicing going to help do that?" Fluttershy asked.

"Hopefully its going to lower your fear of rejection, by showing you how it *could* go," Rarity answered, "we will also practice being rejected."

"What do I do now?" Fluttershy asked.

"Keep practicing, even if it is just mouthing the words," Rarity answered.

Fluttershy tried again, still only mouthing the words.

*Come on Fluttershy, you can do this!*

She tried again, same result.

She kept trying again and again, all while Rarity sat there patiently.

Every time she failed, she only wanted to prove she could do it more.

*You got this. You must do this if you want the chance to be with her.*

She tried again, this time making a sound, not even a full word or part of a word, but a sound.

"That's progress, you're doing great," Rarity said.

This made Fluttershy feel better.

*You will ask Rainbow out!*, she thought.

She tried again.

"R..." She managed to say.

Rarity smiled at Fluttershy, "you can do it!"

Fluttershy tried again. "R..." same result.

She tried over and over, each time giving herself a little pep talk before each attempt.

*You can do this, Fluttershy!*

*You will overcome this obstacle!*

*You must be able to do this!*

*You will do it for her.*

Eventually she managed something resembling a word.

"Rain..." Fluttershy said.

Rarity hugged Fluttershy, "you got this, you're doing great darling."

Fluttershy returned the hug, "thank you."

Fluttershy closed her eyes, letting her mind wonder. She thought of the pony she yearned for.

*Oh Rainbow, I wish I could just tell you. Hopefully this practice works.*

Rarity had let go of the hug, but Fluttershy only hugged Rainbow tighter. Rarity just sat there for her friend, letting her have a break.

A few moments later Fluttershy realized she wasn't holding Rainbow Dash, "oh, sorry Rarity."

"Ti's nothing, darling," Rarity answered, "I'm always here for you."

"Thanks," Fluttershy replied.

"Do you want to keep practicing?" Rarity asked.

"Yes," Fluttershy answered with a determined look.

Fluttershy continued to practice, "Rainb..."

She would get so far and then just freeze up, taking her a moment before she could try again.

"Rainb..."

*Come on Fluttershy, you can do this!*

"Rainbo..."

She kept going until she was able to say her full name.

"Rainbow Dash..."

Rarity congratulated Fluttershy on her progress, "you are doing great, darling."

"thank you, Rarity," Fluttershy replied, "your patience and support are really helping."

Fluttershy leaned back on the couch, lowering her shoulders and letting out a tired breath.

Rarity asked, "would you like to take a break darling?"

"Sure," Fluttershy answered, "overcoming social interactions is hard."

"Yes, it took me quite a while before I was able to just ask her out," Rarity said.

"Do, you really think I can do it, Rarity?" Fluttershy asked in a demur tone.

"I know you can," Rarity answered, "I believe in you and will do everything I can to help you ask her out!"

"Thank you, Rarity," Fluttershy said.

After a few seconds of silence Rarity asked, "what made you realize you liked her more than a friend? If you don't mind sharing, of course."

"I feel safest around her," Fluttershy said after a few seconds, "she is always there for me and does things for me even when I know she doesn't want to."

Fluttershy continued, "we have been close friends since childhood, I feel a closeness to her that's hard to explain. When she puts her wing around me, I can barely keep it in, my heart just flutters..."

"Don't even get me started on her looks, she's so pretty. How does she look so cool and beautiful at the same time? How am I suppose to get her interested in me? Oh, I want to kiss her so much..."

Fluttershy realized she was rambling, stopped speaking and turned to Rarity.

"Sounds like you love her," Rarity said.

"I do," Fluttershy said.

Rarity replied, "you need to channel you love into asking her out, use it as your determination to ask her out."

Fluttershy said, "I'll try, Rarity."

After a moment of silence Fluttershy asked, "how about you?"

"Beg your pardon?" Rarity asked.

Fluttershy asked, "what made you realize you liked Pinkie romantically?"

Rarity answered, "how she can always makes me smile. She is always doing her best to make everypony smile. Whenever I'm having a bad day, she is always there for me. Even her just being with me makes me feel better."

"Her creativity, if I'm out of ideas for a dress, she tries so hard to help come up with some, sure some of them don't always work, but she gets there in the end."

"She's so pretty, my heart skips a beat just looking at her. Her smile is just so infectious, it's impossible to not smile back at her. Her kisses are like magic, each one makes my head spin and my ears drop."

"I wish we could spend more time together, but we're both very busy mares," Rarity finished.

Fluttershy replied, "you should get your wish when you go on your date."

"Yes, I'm very excited for it, I can't wait to see what Pinkie has planned," Rarity said.

"The idea of going on a date with Rainbow Dash makes me nervous, I would probably ruin it by being too shy," Fluttershy lamented.

"Oh, don't say that, I bet you two would have a lovely time. I do hope she says yes, I'm positive you two would be great together!" Rarity said.

"You really think so?" Fluttershy asked.

"Absolutely darling," Rarity answered.

"Thanks Rarity, I hope so too," Fluttershy said.

"do you want to get back to practicing?" Rarity asked.

Fluttershy answered, "yes."

<p align="center">***</p>

Rainbow Dash stepped out of her front door, closing it behind her. She took a few steps to the ledge of her house's landing, before falling off and spreading her wings. She flew towards Sugarcube Corner while grappling with her feelings for Fluttershy.

*You've got to ask her out at some point.*

*but what if she says no?* she argued with herself.

*Then accept it, go cry to yourself and move on.*

*I don't want to cry, I want to be with Fluttershy...*

*The only way you will find out if she likes you back is to ask.*

*I know...*

*Why are you putting it off?*

*...I don't want to be vulnerable, I'm supposed to be tough.*

Rainbow noticed Fluttershy walking into Carousel Boutique below her but didn't comment on it.

*You are tough, but you of all ponies should know that to get the reward you have to accept the risk, besides, would Fluttershy ever want to hurt you?*

*No.*

*Then when are you going to ask her out?*

Rainbow thought for a moment before deciding.

*After Rarity and Pinkie go on their date, don't want to get in their way of having a good time.*

*Okay, I'm holding you to it.*

*...But you're me?*

Before she could think about it anymore she spotted her destination and started descending down to it. Landing a few steps from the door she trotted into the establishment. She looked around, not seeing Pinkie anywhere she trotted up the stairs and knocked on her door.

Waiting a few moments with no answer she knocks again. After another moment with no answer, she says, "Pinkie, are you in there?" then places her ear against the door.

Not hearing any response she opens the door and walks inside, looking around, she finds out why she hadn't got an answer, Pinkie was still in bed.

Rainbow trotted to her bedside and placed her hoof on Pinkie's resting form saying, "Pinkie?" as she gently shook her.

Pinkie didn't wake up, instead whispering in her sleep, "Rarity.. I want to kiss.. you.."

Rainbow tried again, shaking her a little harder, "Pinkie?"

This time it seemed to work, as Pinkie opened her eyes and started to yawn.

Turning to Rainbow she asked, "hi Dashie, what's up?"

"I came over to help you plan your date, and to eat breakfast if you're willing to make some," Rainbow answered as her stomach growled.

"Sure," Pinkie said with a smile as she got out of bed. She started to stretch before trotting to the door, "let's go downstairs and I'll make us something deliciously delectable."

Rainbow followed her out her door and down into the restaurant's kitchen.

"Got any requests?" Pinkie asked.

Rainbow thinks for a second before deciding, "pancakes."

"Okay, coming right up," Pinkie says before starting to get out the bake ware for pancakes.

"You're pancakes are the best, Pinkie," Rainbow said.

"Thanks," Pinkie replied before she started humming to herself.

Rainbow sat down at the kitchen table and watched Pinkie work.

Pinkie looked back at Dash, asking, "how many you want?"

Rainbow answered, "four."

"You got it," Pinkie said before continuing to hum.

Rainbow stared off into space as she thought about Pinkie's words from last night.

*Has Fluttershy's behavior changed lately?*

*Well, there was last night, I put my wing around her and she leaned into me.*

*..But then I ruined it by tensing up, that's probably why her and Rarity left the room.*

*I hope not..*

*But Fluttershy is at Rarity's right now, doesn't that make Pinkie's theory of Rarity needing help make sense?*

*You make a good point, me. We'll find out for sure when I ask Rarity today.*

*Okay.*

Rainbow lost her train of thought as Pinkie sat a stack of pancakes in front of her.

Rainbow said, "wow, you make them fast."

Pinkie replied, "thank you," as she started making her own pancakes.

Rainbow started eating, she finished 3 of her pancakes by the time Pinkie sat down with her own stack, twice as high as Dash's own.

Rainbow finished her last one then said, "that was great, thank you for the breakfast."

"You're welcome," Pinkie said in between bites of her own pancakes.

Rainbow thought about Fluttershy while Pinkie ate.

*Fluttershy sure is special, I hope she says yes.*

staring at her empty plate she thought, *maybe one day I''ll make pancakes for Fluttershy, that'd be cool.*

*Pinkie would be happy to teach you, you know.*

*Yea, I'll ask her when she's done eating.*

*Isn't that a crazy idea, Rainbow Dash making pancakes for her marefriend. Love makes you do stuff you never thought you would. I'd be happy to do it for her though.*

As Pinkie finished her pancakes, Rainbow looked up at her and asked, "hey, Pinkie, do you think you could teach me how to make pancakes some time? I was thinking it'd be cool if I could make them for Fluttershy."

"Sure," Pinkie said before she got up from the table. She picked up their dishes and placed them in the sink. Sitting back down at the table she said, "when do you wanna learn?"

"How about after we get your date planned? So it doesn't get in the way of the planning," Rainbow answered.

"Okay," Pinkie said.

"How are you wanting to plan the date?" Rainbow asked.

"I can use my party planning skills and all our friends ideas to make the best date we can," Pinkie answered.

"Okay," Rainbow said, "do you have any idea what I could contribute?"

"I want you to keep the weather clear for the date," Pinkie answered.

"I can do that," Rainbow said, "but I want to do more, if I can."

"Like what?" Pinkie asked.

"I don't know yet," Rainbow said, "got any ideas?"

Pinkie thought for a moment before saying, "maybe you could pull us around on our date in a chariot."

Rainbow thought on this for a moment.

*While I think that would be helpful I don't know if that would be awkward or not.*

*I don't think I'd fit the part, they'd probably want a fancy chariot and I'm no fancy pony.*

*Hmm*

"Aha," Rainbow Dash said, "you should ask Twilight for a royal chariot, I feel like that would suit Rarity far more than a boring old chariot pulled by me."

"Ooh, that's a great idea," Pinkie said, "but what would you do then?"

*Hmm, what am I good at?*

*Oh yea, being awesome!*

"I could perform for your date as private entertainment, what do you think?" Rainbow answered.

"That's a awesome idea," Pinkie said.

"I can practice for it every day until the date, I'm sure I can come up with something awesome by then," Rainbow confidently said.

"Okay, thank you," Pinkie said.

"Now, what are you planning on bringing to the date, besides yourself?" Rainbow asked.

"Rarity," Pinkie answered earnestly.

"No, I mean what is your contribution," Rainbow clarified.

"Oh," Pinkie replied, "I haven't figured something out yet."

"What are some ideas you think you could contribute?" Rainbow asked.

Pinkie sits there in thought for a bit, before saying, "I'm good at singing and baking sweets. Maybe I could make our desert."

"That's good," Rainbow said.

"But I feel like I want to do more," Pinkie lamented.

Rainbow thought for a moment before saying, "well, you said you're a good singing so write her a song to show her you're love."

"That's a great idea," Pinkie said.

Pinkie got up from the table and hugged Rainbow, "thank you."

Rainbow hugged back, "you're welcome Pinkie."

After the hug was over Pinkie asked, "who should we go talk to next about planning the party?"

Rainbow thought for a moment as a memory of Fluttershy entering Carousel Boutique entered her mind, "Rarity and Fluttershy, their both at Rarity's I think."

Pinkie said, ”okie-dokie-lokie,” before starting for the door, Rainbow following behind her.

After leaving the establishment, Rainbow said, "I need to ask Rarity about why her and Fluttershy left the room last night."

Pinkie said, "okay."

Rainbow asks, "is it okay if we separate them? You talk to Fluttershy about the date plan and I can ask Rarity about last night."

"Sure," Pinkie said, "but what about asking Rarity about her part of the date?"

"I can ask her if you want," Rainbow said.

"Okay, sounds like a plan," Pinkie said.

"What day are you planning to have the date?" Rainbow asked.

Pinkie thought for a few seconds before saying, "the day after tomorrow. Today we plan, tomorrow we get everything ready and the next day we date."

"Okay," Rainbow said.

<p align="center">***</p>

"Rainbow Dash, w..." Fluttershy managed.

"You're doing great, darling," Rarity exclaimed.

"Rarity, how do I know I wont just lose all my progress once I'm in front of Rainbow Dash?" Fluttershy asked.

"I saw that coming, and I am prepared, after you are fully able to say it, I am going to barrow a Rainbow Dash costume from Pinkie. I will wear the costume and we can practice you asking me out while I'm dressed liked Rainbow," Rarity answered.

"Oh, my," Fluttershy said, "you thought of everything."

"I do my best," Rarity said.

Fluttershy continued her practicing, "Rainbow Dash, W..."

*You will ask her out.*

"Rainbow Dash, W..." Fluttershy said.

*You can do this, Fluttershy!*

"Rainbow Dash, Wi..." Fluttershy said.

"You got this!" Rarity said.

"Rainbow Dash, Wi..." Fluttershy said.

*You will overcome your anxiety.*

"Rainbow Dash, Wil..." Fluttershy managed.

Fluttershy continued to practice, each time giving herself encouragement.

*You can do it!*

*Rainbow Dash will hear you.*

*You must be able to ask her out.*

*She will know how you truly feel.*

Fluttershy managed to say, "Rainbow Dash, will you..."

Rarity gave Fluttershy a congratulatory hug, "you are doing great darling, you've made good progress."

"Thanks Rarity," Fluttershy said returning the hug.

After the hug was over, Rarity asked, "how do you feel now? Do you have more confidence than when we started?"

Fluttershy answered, "I feel better, I feel like I have hope that I could actually do it eventually."

"That's excellent darling," Rarity said.

Fluttershy started practicing again, determined to do this.

*You got this, Fluttershy!*

"Rainbow Dash, will you..." Fluttershy said.

*I will do this!*

"Rainbow Dash, will you g..." Fluttershy said.

*You will succeed.*

"Rainbow Dash, will you g..." Fluttershy said.

"You can do it," Rarity said.

"Rainbow Dash, will you go..." Fluttershy said.

*Make progress, Fluttershy.*

"Rainbow Dash, will you go..." Fluttershy said.

Rarity sat there patiently, occasionally giving Fluttershy words of encouragement.

"You will ask her out," Rarity said.

"Rainbow Dash, will you go o..." Fluttershy said.

*You're doing great!*

"Rainbow Dash, will you go o..." Fluttershy said.

*I believe in me.*

"Rainbow Dash, will you go ou..." Fluttershy said.

*I am determined!*

"Rainbow Dash, will you go ou..." Fluttershy said.

*My feelings will be known.*

"Rainbow Dash, will you go out..." Fluttershy said.

*You are so close Fluttershy.*

"Rainbow Dash, will you go out..." Fluttershy said.

*Two more words and you can take a break.*

"Rainbow Dash, will you go out..." Fluttershy said.

*I will do this.*

"Rainbow Dash, will you go out w..." Fluttershy said.

"I know you can do it!" Rarity cheered.

"Rainbow Dash, will you go out wi..." Fluttershy said.

*Come on Fluttershy, you can do it.*

"Rainbow Dash, will you go out wi..." Fluttershy said.

*I am able to do this.*

"Rainbow Dash, will you go out with..." Fluttershy said.

*I am brave enough to ask her out.*

"Rainbow Dash, will you go out with..." Fluttershy said.

*I am determined to ask her out!*

"You are doing great!" Rarity said.

"Rainbow Dash, will you go out with me?" Fluttershy asked.

Rarity cheered for her, "you did it darling, you did it!"

Fluttershy said, "I did it!"

Rarity hugged Fluttershy, patting her on the back, "you did amazing."

Fluttershy hugged her back, "Thank you Rarity, I couldn't have done it without you."

Rarity pulled away from the hug and asked, "would you like some celebratory pancakes?"

Fluttershy said, "yes, is it Pinkie recipe, I really like her pancakes."

"Yes," Rarity answered, "let's go to the kitchen," before getting up from the couch and going into the kitchen.

Fluttershy followed her into the kitchen and sat down at the table, "thanks for the pancakes, I need the energy if we're going to do more practicing."

"You are most welcome, darling, you've earned it," Rarity said.
