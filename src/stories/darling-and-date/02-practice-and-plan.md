# Practice and Plan

Fluttershy knocked on Rarity's door again, this time a little louder. Getting no answer she sighed as she realized she wan't loud enough. Hanging her head for a second, then opening the door and walking inside.

Looking around the main room, she didn't see Rarity. She tries calling out to her, "Rarity, are you in here?"

Her call was answered, when from the kitchen she heard Rarity, "in here, darling."

Fluttershy walked into the kitchen, seeing Rarity and Sweetie Belle sitting at the table. There wasn't any food on the table so it seems she may have interrupted them, "oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you two."

Rarity replied, "Oh, not at all darling."

Sweetie Belle piped up, "actually Rarity, I wanted to ask you a few questions about relationships, if that's fine?"

Rarity looked at Fluttershy and asked, "you don't mind if we wait a few minutes before we start, do you?"

Fluttershy replied, "no, not at all, do you want me to wait in the other room?"

Rarity was about to say something when Sweetie Belle interrupted, "she can stay."

Rarity looked at Sweetie Belle with a raised eyebrow before turning to Fluttershy, "I guess you can have a seat," as she pulled a chair out with her magic.

Fluttershy sat down and both adult ponies looked at Sweetie Belle expectantly.
