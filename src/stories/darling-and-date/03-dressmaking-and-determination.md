# Dressmaking and Determination

Pinkie Pie carefully placed the cake into the over, closing the door. She set the timer then started cleaning up the kitchen.

*I just know Rarity will love this cake,* she thought excitedly to herself.

*Oh, and I hope she likes the dress.*

*This date is going to be amazing*, she thought.

*Rarity gave me a gift to show me how much she cares, now it's time for me to give her the best date ever.*

She smiled as she cleaned, excited to continue working on her date for the mare she loved.

*Today I need to finish this cake, make Rarity's dress with Fluttershy, and teach Rainbow to make pancakes.*

*The cake is in the oven, so as long as I don't get distracted we're good.*

*Fluttershy will be here sometime, hopefully after Rainbow.*

*Rainbow should be here soon. Since I'm teaching her in the kitchen, I'll be here to hear the timer go off.*

*After the cake is done and cooled down I'll add the special design I thought up.*

*I have a few ideas for the dress, I should be able to talk to Fluttershy about them.*

*I'll start Rainbow with a simple pancake mix, after that we can switch to homemade.*

She finished cleaning, looked around the room for anything she missed, not seeing anything she trotted into the front of the establishment.

She was about to head upstairs to her room when she heard the door open, looking over she see an exhausted looking Fluttershy, breathing heavy.

*Oh, it's Fluttershy.*

Fluttershy recovers and says, "Pinkie, I'm here to make the dress, I carried a ponnequin from Rarity's, it's outside. Can you carry it to your room, those things are surprisingly heavy."

"Sure," Pinkie says as she heads outside, spotting the ponnequin and a large bag with fabric inside.

Pinkie takes the bag in her mouth and does her best to carry the ponnequin inside and upstairs to her room.

*She's right, this thing is heavy.*

Once upstairs, Fluttershy opens Pinkie's bedroom door for her and closes it behind herself once Pinkie has made it inside.

Pinkie sets the ponnequin down in the center of her room, then setting the bag of fabric beside it.

Fluttershy looks at Pinkie, saying, "I may have told Rarity the dress was for her... but I only told her it was from me, she will be surprised when you give it to her for the date."

"Oh," Pinkie replied, "that's okay."

Fluttershy continued, "I didn't know how else to get the ponnequin and right fabric colors to match her colors."

Pinkie reassured her, "that was a good idea."

"Thank you," Fluttershy said.

"Well, let's see what we have to work with," Pinkie said before taking the big bag and dumping the fabric over her bed.

Bolts of fabric flew from the bag, landing on every corner of her bedspread. There were lots of colors and more than one shade of some colors.

Pinkie pointed to each one as she said its color, "white, blue, pink, purple, light blue, green, light pink."

Pinkie looked inside the bag, finding dozens of differently colored gemstones, "there's more in here," she said as she dumped then in the center of her bed.

"Looks like we have a lot to work with," Fluttershy said.

"We sure do," Pinkie said before looking over the pile of dress ingredients splayed out on her bed, "Rarity made my dress pink, should we make her dress white?" Pinkie asked, picking up the white bolt of fabric.

"That sounds good," Fluttershy said.
