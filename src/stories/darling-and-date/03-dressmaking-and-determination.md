# Dressmaking and Determination

Pinkie Pie carefully placed the cake into the over, closing the door. She set the timer then started cleaning up the kitchen.

*I just know Rarity will love this cake,* she thought excitedly to herself.

*Oh, and I hope she likes the dress.*

*This date is going to be amazing*, she thought.

*Rarity gave me a gift to show me how much she cares, now it's time for me to give her the best date ever.*

She smiled as she cleaned, excited to continue working on her date for the mare she loved.

*Today I need to finish this cake, make Rarity's dress with Fluttershy, and teach Rainbow to make pancakes.*

*The cake is in the oven, so as long as I don't get distracted we're good.*

*Fluttershy will be here sometime, hopefully after Rainbow.*

*Rainbow should be here soon. Since I'm teaching her in the kitchen, I'll be here to hear the timer go off.*

*After the cake is done and cooled down I'll add the special design I thought up.*

*I have a few ideas for the dress, I should be able to talk to Fluttershy about them.*

*I'll start Rainbow with a simple pancake mix, after that we can switch to homemade.*
