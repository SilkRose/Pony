# Dressmaking and Determination

Pinkie Pie carefully placed the cake into the over, closing the door. She set the timer then started cleaning up the kitchen.

*I just know Rarity will love this cake,* she thought excitedly to herself.

*Oh, and I hope she likes the dress.*

*This date is going to be amazing*, she thought.

*Rarity gave me a gift to show me how much she cares, now it's time for me to give her the best date ever.*

She smiled as she cleaned, excited to continue working on her date for the mare she loved.

*Today I need to finish this cake, make Rarity's dress with Fluttershy, and teach Rainbow to make pancakes.*

*The cake is in the oven, so as long as I don't get distracted we're good.*

*Fluttershy will be here sometime, hopefully after Rainbow.*

*Rainbow should be here soon. Since I'm teaching her in the kitchen, I'll be here to hear the timer go off.*

*After the cake is done and cooled down I'll add the special design I thought up.*

*I have a few ideas for the dress, I should be able to talk to Fluttershy about them.*

*I'll start Rainbow with a simple pancake mix, after that we can switch to homemade.*

She finished cleaning, looked around the room for anything she missed, not seeing anything she trotted into the front of the establishment.

She was about to head upstairs to her room when she heard the door open, looking over she see an exhausted looking Fluttershy, breathing heavy.

*Oh, it's Fluttershy.*

Fluttershy recovers and says, "Pinkie, I'm here to make the dress, I carried a ponnequin from Rarity's, it's outside. Can you carry it to your room, those things are surprisingly heavy."

"Sure," Pinkie says as she heads outside, spotting the ponnequin and a large bag with fabric inside.

Pinkie takes the bag in her mouth and does her best to carry the ponnequin inside and upstairs to her room.

*She's right, this thing is heavy.*

Once upstairs, Fluttershy opens Pinkie's bedroom door for her and closes it behind herself once Pinkie has made it inside.

Pinkie sat the ponnequin down in the center of her room, then setting the bag of fabric beside it.

Fluttershy looked at Pinkie and said, "I may have told Rarity the dress was for her... but I only told her it was from me, she will be surprised when you give it to her for the date."

"Oh," Pinkie replied, "that's okay."

Fluttershy continued, "I didn't know how else to get the ponnequin and right fabric colors to match her colors."

Pinkie reassured her, "that was a good idea."

"Thank you," Fluttershy said.

"Well, let's see what we have to work with," Pinkie said before taking the big bag and dumping the fabric over her bed.

Bolts of fabric flew from the bag, landing on every corner of her bedspread. There were lots of colors and more than one shade of some colors.

Pinkie pointed to each one as she said its color, "white, blue, pink, purple, light blue, green, light pink."

Pinkie looked inside the bag, finding dozens of differently colored gemstones, "there's more in here," she said as she dumped then in the center of her bed.

"Looks like we have a lot to work with," Fluttershy said.

"We sure do," Pinkie said before looking over the pile of dress ingredients splayed out on her bed, "Rarity made my dress pink, should we make her dress white?" Pinkie asked, picking up the white bolt of fabric.

"That sounds good," Fluttershy said.

Pinkie brought the bolt of fabric and gave it to Fluttershy.

Fluttershy began by unrolling a few lengths of fabric, "hold this," she said, giving the end of the fabric to Pinkie.

Pinkie took it between her hooves before Fluttershy got some scissors and cut the fabric at the bolt end.

Fluttershy placed the cut fabric over the ponnequin, centering it on its back.

Pinkie looked at Fluttershy, asking, "how do you make a dress?"

Fluttershy answered, "I don't know, all we can do is think it through. I know we made Rarity's dress for the Gala, but that was already designed, now we have to design and make the dress."

"Yea, did you have any ideas in mind?" Pinkie asked.

"We should try to use colors that go well with Rarity's appearance, Rarity already did that by picking the colors of the fabric," Fluttershy said.

"That's good," Pinkie said.

Fluttershy asked, "do you have some safety pins? I need to hold this fabric in place."

"Yes, I'll be right back" Pinkie said before leaving the room.

Going into her upstairs bathroom. She opened a drawer on a cabinet and found them, she took as many as she could carry and returned to Fluttershy.

"Here you go," Pinkie said after she laid them down in front of Fluttershy.

"Thanks," Fluttershy said before she picked one up in her mouth. She pinned it in the fabric, holding the front two sides together at the chest of the ponnequin.

"Do you think we should put gems on it?" Pinkie asked.

"Maybe, Rarity did include them in the bag," Fluttershy said.

A few seconds later, Fluttershy asked, "how long do you want the dress to be? Do you want it short or do you want it long?"

"Let's make it long, more regal like, I think," Pinkie answered.

"Okay, I need you to hold up the skirt so I can cut it at the right length," Fluttershy said.

"Okay," Pinkie said as she lifted the skirt in her hooves, spreading it out behind the ponnequin.

Fluttershy carefully went around in a circle cutting the fabric at the right length. After the cut was over, Pinkie let the fabric hang.

Taking a step back, both mares looked at the newly cut skirt.

Fluttershy said, "I think it looks good, the cut wasn't perfect, but we should be able to fix it."

Pinkie said, "yea, I think it looks good too."

Fluttershy asked, "do you have any ideas for the dress?"

Pinkie took a moment looking at the current state of the dress.

*We haven't done much so far, what would be good to do next?*

*I like the flowing skirt, maybe we should bring more attention to it?*

Pinkie said, "let's make the skirt pop somehow."

Fluttershy thought for a second before suggesting, "like an edge trim?"

"Yea, let's make it purple to match her mane," Pinkie said ecstatically.

"Okay," Fluttershy said before she went and picked up the purple bolt of fabric.

She unwound a single fold from the bolt, "how thick do you want the trim?" Fluttershy asked.

Pinkie imagined the trim on the dress, *hmm.* She held her hoof up to her imagination and said, "about half my hoof."

"Okay," Fluttershy said as she began to cut the fabric to length.

Fluttershy held the purple strip up to the skirt, aligning it, "can you hold this?" Fluttershy asked.

Pinkie held it as Fluttershy pinned it with a safely pin.

"Every time I add a pin, move a few inches along and I'll pin it again," Fluttershy explained.

They worked together slowly getting the purple trim held in place, occasionally stopping to cut more purple fabric.

"There," Fluttershy said as they finished, "now it's held in place we can sew it on."

Fluttershy looked at Pinkie, "do you have a sewing needle and thread?"

Pinkie shook her head before thinking, *maybe Rarity sent some.*

Going over to the bag Rarity had sent, she looked inside, finding exactly what she needed, a small pouch. Pulling it out she opened it, find several sewing needles and spools of thread.

"Here you go," Pinkie said with a smile, handing the pouch to Fluttershy.

Fluttershy began sewing the purple trim to the skirt, slowly, taking her time.

Pinkie remembered the cake, *oh, I should go check on it.*

"Do you need me?" Pinkie asked, "I need to go check the cake I have in the over, its for the date."

Fluttershy answered, "not right now, you can go."

"Thank you," Pinkie said, gently giving her a hug, trying not to disturb her.

"You're welcome," Fluttershy said with a smile.

With that Pinkie trotted out of the room, making her way downstairs.

Turning the corner at the bottom of the stairs, she sees Rainbow walking towards her.

"Hi Pinkie, I'm here to learn how to make pancakes," Rainbow said.

*I guess I can do two things at once.*

"Okay, let's go to the kitchen," Pinkie said before leading Rainbow to the kitchen.

Pinkie checks the timer, *still a while till the cake is ready.*

Pinkie got out a box of pancake mix and a big bowl, and two of everything they needed; frying pan, mixing bowl, various measuring cups, whisk, plate and spatula.

Pinkie turns to Rainbow, "we are going to start with making pancakes from pancake mix, this will help you learn the basics."

Rainbow said, "okay."

Pinkie continued, "after we are good with these we will move onto homemade pancakes."

Rainbow said, "okay, I'm excited to learn."

Pinkie finished, "I'm going to make pancakes right beside you so you can watch and ask questions."

"Sounds good," Rainbow said.

Pinkie got out a stick of butter from the fridge and two butter knives from a drawer.

Pinkie instructed, "open the pancake mix and pour a decent amount into that big bowl," as she pointed to the bowl.

Rainbow did as instructed, "is that good?"

"Yes," Pinkie said, "now take a one cup measuring cup and put 2 cups of pancake mix into your mixing bowl."

Rainbow did as she was told before Pinkie also did it.

"Okay, now add one and a half cups of water," Pinkie said.

Rainbow does as instructed, "now we stir it, right?"

"Yes, good eye," Pinkie said as she added her water.

They both picked up their whisks and started to stir, Rainbow watched Pinkie closely, making sure she was stirring correctly.

After Pinkie stopped stirring, Rainbow stopped too.

Pinkie looked at Rainbow's mixed batter, "looks good."

"Now what?" Rainbow asked.

"Take your pan, and place it on the stove, and place your plate next to the stove," Pinkie said.

Rainbow did so in step with Pinkie.

"Now, we are going to turn the stove on," Pinkie said as she turned on her burner to the four setting.

Rainbow followed suit, "how long do we wait to pour the batter?"

"A few minutes, but before we place in the batter we want to add some butter to the pan, to keep it from sticking," Pinkie explained.

Rainbow looked at the butter, "how much do we add?"

"One tablespoon," Pinkie said before cutting off said amount from the stick of butter.

Rainbow copied her.

After waiting till the pans were hot, Pinkie took the wrapping on her butter and placed it in the center of the pan.

The butter in Pinkie's pan started to sizzle as Rainbow unwrapped her butter before putting it in her own pan.

Pinkie used her butter knife to spread the butter around the pan, Rainbow following suit.

"Now pour in the batter, the amount you pour in makes them bigger or smaller," Pinkie said before picking up her mixing bowl.

Pinkie waited for Rainbow to be ready to pour, once ready they poured in the same amount, Rainbow stopping on Pinkie's queue, "that's good."

"Now, we let them cook, depending on the stove it can take different amounts of time, for this one we wait ninety seconds on the first half and sixty seconds on the second half," Pinkie said.

"Okay," Rainbow said.

Pinkie picked up her spatula, Rainbow mimicking her.

About ninety seconds later Pinkie flipped her pancake, Rainbow watched and then flipped her own, almost dropping it in the process.

"You're doing good," Pinkie said.

"Thanks," Rainbow said.

Sixty seconds later Pinkie picked up her pancake and laid it on her plate, Rainbow doing the same.

"You did it!" Pinkie exclaimed excitedly.

"How'd it turn out?" Rainbow asked.

Pinkie took a closer look at Rainbow's pancake, "it definitely is a beginner pancake, but a good beginner pancake at that."

"Cool," Rainbow said.

"Let's make a few more," Pinkie said.

"Okay," Rainbow said.

With that they both made three more pancakes, making a total of four each.

Pinkie noticed Rainbow's quality going up somewhat with each one Rainbow made.

"You're getting better," Pinkie said.

"Awesome," Rainbow said.

"Why don't you make 4 more while I'm gone, I need to go upstairs for a bit," Pinkie explained.

"Okay," Rainbow said, as she started on the next pancake.

Pinkie checked the timer on the cake and went upstairs to work with Fluttershy.
