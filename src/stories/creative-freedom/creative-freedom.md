# Creative Freedom

I open the door to Twilight's library, heading inside as I slow my tears.

*Come on, Rarity, get yourself together.*

Looking around, I find Twilight reading a book.

I wipe away my tears and go over to her, tapping her should. "Twilight?"

Twilight's ears perk, but her gaze remains on her book. "Oh, hey Rarity, what's up?"

I fidget. "I wanted to ask you something… I wanted to know if you had written any books…" I say, shaken.

Twilight tilts her head in confusion, but keeps reading. "I've thought about it, but so far no. Why do you ask?"

"Oh, I had assumed you did because you live in a library and read so much… I guess it's not important…" I say before I turn around and start to shamble towards the door.

"Huh, what does that mean?" Twilight finally glances from her book and spots my crestfallen face. "Rarity, what's going on?"

I turn back to her as a few more tears escape me. "I just wanted to talk to somepony… I thought you might understand my plight, thinking you were another creative."

Twilight gazes softly at me in concern. "Well, maybe I don't have that sort of creative experience. But I'm still here to listen to whatever you need to get off your chest."

"I feel like I don't design for myself anymore, everything I make now is for other ponies, to get their admiration, their praise."

The tears start to flow down my face. "I feel like it's never enough anymore, I'm constantly trying to outdo my last design, and I always come out wanting."

My hoof starts to shake. "I can't think for myself anymore, all I latch onto is other ponies thoughts and opinions on my designs."

I collapse onto Twilight, holding her. "I can't even finish a dress now, it takes me days to make any progress, constantly rethinking and nitpicking everything I do."
