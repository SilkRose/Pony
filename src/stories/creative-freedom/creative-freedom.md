# Creative Freedom

I open the door to Twilight's library, heading inside as I slow my tears.

*Come on, Rarity, get yourself together.*

Looking around, I find Twilight reading a book.

I wipe away my tears and go over to her, tapping her should. "Twilight?"

Twilight's ears perk, but her gaze remains on her book. "Oh, hey Rarity, what's up?"

I fidget. "I wanted to ask you something… I wanted to know if you had written any books…" I say, shaken.

Twilight tilts her head in confusion, but keeps reading. "I've thought about it, but so far no. Why do you ask?"

"Oh, I had assumed you did because you live in a library and read so much… I guess it's not important…" I say before I turn around and start to shamble towards the door.

"Huh, what does that mean?" Twilight finally glances from her book and spots my crestfallen face. "Rarity, what's going on?"

I turn back to her as a few more tears escape me. "I just wanted to talk to somepony… I thought you might understand my plight, thinking you were another creative."

Twilight gazes softly at me in concern. "What's going on? I've never seen you this distraught before. I- I don't have the same creative experience as you, but I'm always here to talk."

I try my best to steady my breath. "I feel like I don't design for myself anymore, everything I make now is for other ponies, to get their admiration, their praise."

The tears start to flow down my face. "I feel like it's never enough anymore, I'm constantly trying to outdo my last design, and I always come out wanting."

My hoof starts to shake. "I can't think for myself anymore, all I latch onto is other ponies thoughts and opinions on my designs."

I collapse onto Twilight, holding her. "I can't even finish a dress now, it takes me days to make any progress, constantly rethinking and nitpicking everything I do."

Twilight slowly massages my back with a hoof. "You'll be alright Rarity, I'm here now. Why don't we go over it one at a time?"

"Well," I sniff and wipe some of the tears from my face." Like I said, I feel like all I make dresses for now are just to get admiration and praise."

"What do you mean? Haven't you always loved getting praise and love for your dresses?"

"It's different now, Twilight. I used to be able to go with the wind, as it were. Now I work a rigid schedule; it feels like there is no time for *me* anymore."

"Really? The girls and I, we still see you every so often. It hasn't seemed like you've been gone any longer than before?"

"Yes, I spend nearly all my free time with you girls. I seldom get a moment to myself, and when I do, I'm too tired to work."

"Oh, I'm… I'm sorry you've been feeling like that lately. You could've told us! If we knew, we could've given you some time for yourself."

"Never the one to disappoint, I wanted to be there for all my friends. I suppose I should have still said something… I'm sorry too."

"Well, you can always talk to us, Rarity. If you'd like some time for yourself, we'd be more than happy to get that! We are always here for you."

"Thanks, Twilight, but that's not all. Every dress I make feels worse than the last one, like I'm not a fashion designer anymore. I feel like a failure, despite everypony telling me I'm not."

"But like you said, you're not a failure, Rarity! You have so many open fashion lines, constantly bring in new customers, always making new, unique designs. If anything, you're the exact opposite of failure!"

I squeeze Twilight a little tighter. "But it doesn't change how I feel. I want each new dress to be better than the last, but right now, they aren't."
