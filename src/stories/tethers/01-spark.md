# Spark

Nothing.

Emptiness.

Eternal black.

*Twinkle.*

And at that moment you were born.

In the briefest of glimpses, you see a purple unicorn, standing with a smile in the middle of her 5 friends as they face down a mare of pure night.

Just like it came into view, it vanished. You don't know how you knew what they were, or where you disappeared too. 

You feel connected to them, like they are still so close and yet still so far away, like it would take 9 years to see them again, as if you knew exactly how long it would take.

You look around in this new place, it feels connected to the place where you came from. You see lights moving, some move fast, some slow. So many colors, some brighter than others.

After you take a moment to get acquainted with your new surroundings, you notice you are moving the slowest out of any lights you see. Not in control of where you are going, you just move.

You see a light moving to where you came from, this one a special one, it wasn't like the other ones, this one changed colors and was a lot brighter than most, sweeping through 6 distinct colors. It passes by you, as you pass by it emanates thoughts.

*A blue pegasus filly performing a sonic rainboom to defend her friend and earns her cutie mark.*

*A yellow pegasus befriends some scared animals and earns her cutie mark.*

*A orange earth pony filly goes home where she belongs and gets her cutie mark.*

*A pink earth pony filly throws her family a party and earns her cutie mark.*

*A white unicorn discovered her affinity for finding gemstones and earns her cutie mark.*

*A purple unicorn casts uncontrolled magic and earns her cutie mark.*

As you absorb the last thought, you realize those ponies are the same as the ones who sparked you into existence, but a lot younger. You notice yourself emanating thoughts like it did.

*A purple unicorn mare happy to hear her friends.*

*A pink earth pony mare glad to see her friend is okay.*

*A white unicorn mare relieved her friend is unhurt.*

*A blue pegasus mare alleviated her friend is fine.*

*A yellow pegasus mare allayed her friend is safe.*

*A orange earth pony mare glad her friend is okay.*

After reliving your creation, you realize you are different from the rest, like the other one rotating the same 6 colors. After a moment, the light that passed you disappears. You feel a strong presence shift as the light fades from existence.

As you continue your eternal march forward, you look around for any more lights that might get close enough for you to hear them, to understand them and this place more.

As it would happen, there is a small green light about to pass you, moving at a moderate pace, as it passes you absorb its thought.

*A green unicorn hugging her beige earth pony friend.*

*'Who are those ponies? Where is that orb going? What happens when it gets there?'* you think to yourself.
