# Chapter 1: How Sagwa Got To Equestria

Sagwa rode on top of Fluttershy’s head, while her two siblings, Sheegwa, and Dongwa, rode on Fluttershy’s back. She was taking them to a friend who might be able to help them get back home.

Fluttershy said, “we're almost there,” as she trotted down a dirt path leading to a giant crystalline castle.

“Who is this friend of yours, Fluttershy?” asked Sagwa.

“Her name is, Twilight Sparkle, if anypony can get you three back home, it’s her,” Fluttershy answered.
