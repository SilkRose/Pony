* The three cats help Opal be a better person. (strive to do better)
* Dongwa likes Opal now for both looks and personality. (romance is fun, but tricky.)
* Dongwa and Opal end up in a relationship, but Dongwa is a very traditional cat, unlike Opal, they must come to a compromise to continue dating. (compromise and communicate.)
* Rarity is having trouble designing a dress, Sagwa helps her. (helping your friends is nice)
* Sagwa wants to find her place in the world, she finds Twilight and writes scrolls for her, like she did in the palace for the magistrate. (do what you love)
* Sagwa wants to write a play, but she keeps redoing it because it's not perfect. (don’t be a perfectionist.)
* Sagwa tells a newcomer to the sanctuary how the three cats ended up there. (sometimes stuff happens you can’t control.)
* Last chapter is them being offered a way home, they have a hard time deciding. (sometimes you got to make hard choices)
* Sheegwa gets her markings, if she hasn’t already, in the show. (growing up)

#### Need sorted:
* Think for yourself
* Ask questions
* Explore
* Be careful but not overcautious
* When should you take risks
* Being resourceful, able to make things
* Things don't always go as planned
