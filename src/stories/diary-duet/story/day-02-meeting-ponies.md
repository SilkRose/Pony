# Day 02: Meeting Ponies

Day 2: Fur-less Fun New Friend

Dear diary

I met a new friend today! Twilight was showing a new guy in town, ya know the town and they came to Sugarcube Corner. He is not a pony, he is a human he said. I don't know what that is, but humans are tall and don't have any fur. He said his name was Josh. I told him he needs a welcome party and he didn't understand why. Everypony needs a welcome party, duh! I gave him a welcome to Ponyville hug and he started tearing upâ€¦ He hugged me tighter and wiped away the tears. He apologized and I told him he didn't need to. He tried to explain it but I shushed him, I already knew, auntie Pinkie Pie always knows. Twilight didn't know about the tears and I decided it was Josh's decision if he wanted to say. When the hug was over he whispered thank you in my ear. I smiled at them and they left soon after. I sure hope his welcome to Ponyville party tomorrow does him some good, sure looks like he needs it. I'll let you know what happens tomorrow.

Day 2: Pretty Pink Pony

Dear diary

Today Twilight took me around town to show me around. The first stop was at a place called Sugarcube Corner. It was an interesting encounter, there we met a pink earth pony named Pinkie Pie. She sure was an interesting character, so full of energy and life, I wish I was more like her. She said she wanted to throw me a welcome to Ponyville party. I told her it wasn't necessary, I think she's going to do it anyway. When we were about to leave she gave me a hug and.. and I just started tearing up,  It was the first time in a while I'd had physical contact with another person, and it was a cute and soft pony. I guess I needed it and she could tell, she let the hug go on for as long as I wanted. When it was over, as I was pulling away I whispered thank you in her ear. Twilight had a puzzled look on her face, I didn't want to talk about it so we left after saying goodbye to Pinkie Pie.
