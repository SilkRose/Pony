# Day 02: Meeting Ponies

Dear diary,

Today I was on my way to Twilight's, when I ran into Spike and Josh. Spike had introduced Josh to Rarity, and they were just leaving when I found them.

I asked if I could finish showing Josh the town since we got rained out yesterday. He said yes and Spike decided to go back home.

I showed him all around town, the market, town hall, post office, train station. He seemed pretty overwhelmed with it all, so I thought we could slow down and go see Fluttershy.

Fluttershy was very much, shy at the start, but as they talked she opened up. Josh said he had a cat back home and they got into it about how cute cats are.

Fluttershy was very curious about humans, and the other animals that were on his planet. It was nice seeing them bond. When we left, Josh gave Fluttershy a big hug. I think he likes hugs!
