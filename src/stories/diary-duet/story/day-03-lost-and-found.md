# Day 03: Lost and Found

Dear diary,

Today I took a walk around town, to try to clear my mind and just think. I realized something during that walk.

Twilight and Pinkie are my friends.

I know that might not sound like a big revelation, both of them have been nothing but amazing towards me. I guess I just haven't thought about it till now.

I'm still not used to this world, sure the ponies are really nice and friendly, but everything is made for them, not me.

I don't know how long I'm going to be here, or how long it's going to take for me to adjust to living here.

After I realized they were my friends, I realized I liked Pinkie more. Right now, I don't know why. I mean Twilight is the one letting me stay with her, and she's trying to help me get home.

I ended up getting lost of the walk, I had no idea where I was or what to do. I didn't recognize anyone around me, then as I was standing there trying to think of what to do, I had a panic attack.

I remember seeing what I thought was the way to Fluttershy's house, and I ran. I don't remember much, but I do remember hugging Fluttershy and crying.

I don't know why I had a panic attack, I never got any back home. I can only assume it's from being in this new world.

Apparently Fluttershy was the right pony to go to, she said she has panic attacks from time to time. After I had calmed down and let go of her, we talked a lot.

the conversation is kinda blur to me, all I can vividly remember is her reassuring me that it's okay and then giving me a hug.

Fluttershy walked me back to Twilight's, I made sure to thank her and give her another hug.

I haven't told Twilight about the panic attack, might wait a day or two.

I think I need to go to sleep after that, night.
