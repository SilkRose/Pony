# Day 01

Day 1: Brave New World

Dear diary,

I'M IN A LAND OF MAGICAL TALKING PONIES!

WHAT!

So, yea… I should probably start from the beginning. I went to bed last night and woke up in a strange new world. I was in a field of apple trees. I didn't know where I was or where to go so I headed to a barn I saw in the distance.

I was not ready for what awaited me there, it was an orange talking magical horse… or pony as they like to be called. And we could understand each other. She introduced herself as Applejack and said she was glad to meet me.

I was not sure if I was on something or dead, all I could say was 'Whats going on? Where am I?' She answered, saying I was at Sweet Apple Acres and that she didn't know where I came from or how I got there. Once I calmed down, we talked for a bit and she recommended I talk to her friend Twilight Sparkle, a magical magical talking horse pony thing.

Applejack leads me through town to a giant castle thing, from the outside It looked more like a child's play set than a castle. She introduced me and left to finish her chores.

Twilight and I talked for hours, about where I came from and where I am now. She said she would try and help me get home. That makes me feel better. She suggested I start writing in a diary to keep my thoughts in order, so now I have you.

She said this place is called Equestria, and this town is called Ponyville. She said I could stay with her for now. She offered to show me the town, but before we got out the door one of her friends shows up, a pink pony named Pinkie Pie.

This new pony had no idea what personal space was and decided to sing me a 'Welcome to Ponyville' song. Twilight told her what we were doing and Pinkie Pie asked if she can show me the town instead, and Twilight agreed, assuring me Pinkie was a good guide.

Pinkie and I left the castle, heading to see the town, but right after we got to Sugarcube Corner, Pinkie's home, it started to rain. Pinkie suggested we could hang out in her room. I didn't have any other options, so I agreed.

We hung out for a few hours, just talking about all sorts of stuff and playing games. Most of the games were hard to play, her room is too small to play tag effectively, not many places to hide for hide and seek. Even thought it wasn't the most optimal place to play, I still had a lot of fun.

We talked about way different stuff than I talked to Twilight about. She asked all sorts of random questions, favorite color, what I do for fun, if I'd eaten yet. Apparently she's a confectionery expert, and I can confirm. The food she made was delicious.

She's always smiling, makes it hard to not smile back. Her positive energy is just infectious. She reassured me that everything was going to be alright. I don't know how I feel exactly, but her confidence makes me feel better.

Eventually the day was ending, and she took me back to Twilight's. When she left she gave me a hug. As I was hugging her I couldn't help but think of two things: *ponies are very soft*, and *Pinkie is ~~cute~~ cool.*

Dear diary,

I made a new friend today!!

I met him at Twilight's. I was going to show him around town, but then it started raining.

We hung out in my room, I made sure we had lots of fun!

I could tell he was nervous being in a new place. I mean who wouldn't?

I reassured him, and I think it helped.

Dear diary,

I was having trouble sleeping, I can only guess why.

I got up and wandered the halls, ending up getting lost. A small dragon found me, assuring me he wasn't going to eat me. His name is Spike, he's Twilight's assistant. He showed me around, and said it's easy to get lost in here. *Tell me about it.*

We ended up bonding over being the only one of our kind in Ponyville. He said you get used to it.

I asked him if we could eat something, and he offered to make food. His food was good, but not as good as Pinkie's.

He seemed a little embarrassed when he asked if I wanted something to sleep with. I asked what he meant and he showed me a small plush of a white unicorn with a purple mane.

I didn't know what to say so I just agreed. He told me the white one he had was of Rarity, the mare he has a crush on. *That's cute.* He said tomorrow he could introduce me to her.

He gave me one, of the same mare.

Maybe it will help, we'll see.

He showed me back to my room, now I'm going to try and sleep now, night.
