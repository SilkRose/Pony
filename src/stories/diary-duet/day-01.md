Day 1: Brave New World

*Dear diary*

*I'M IN A LAND OF MAGICAL TALKING PONIES! So I should probably start from the beginning. I went to bed last night and woke up in a strange new world. I was in a field of apple trees. I didn't know where I was or where to go so I headed to a barn I saw in the distance. I was not ready for what awaited me there, it was an orange talking magical horse... Or pony as they like to be called. And we could understand each other. She introduced herself as Applejack and said she was glad to meet me. I was not sure if I was on drugs or dead, all I could say was ‘whats going on? where am I?’ She answered, saying I was at Sweet Apple Acres and that she didn't know where I came from or how I got there. Once I calmed down, we talked for a bit and she recommended I talk to her friend Twilight Sparkle, a magical magical talking horse pony thing. Applejack leads me through town to a giant castle thing, from the outside It looked more like a child’s toy than a castle. She introduced me and left to finish her chores. Twilight and I talked for hours about where I came from and where I am now. She said she would try and help me get home. That makes me feel better. She suggested I start writing in a diary to keep my thoughts in order, so now I have you. She said this place is called Equestria, and this town is called Ponyville. She said I could stay with her for now. She offered to show me the town, but before we got out the door one of her friends shows up, a pink pony named Pinkie Pie. this new pony had no idea what personal space was and decided to sing me a ‘welcome to Ponyville’ song. Twilight told her what we were doing and Pinkie Pie asks if she can show me the town instead, and Twilight agreed, assuring me Pinkie was a good guide.*
