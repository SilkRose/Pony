# Diary Duet

## Day 1: Discovery

Dear diary,

I think I have a crush on Rarity. Today at our weekly spa trip, I couldn't stop looking at her. I kept thinking about her, how beautiful she looks, how nice she is, how much I *loved* the hug she gave me.

I don't know what to do diary… I wanted to panic, but I couldn't help but feel calm around her. She did notice me acting strange, I lied to her, which made me cry when I got home…

Maybe tomorrow we can hang out some more, I might get a better grasp over my feelings then, I hope…

## Day 2: Difference

Dear diary,

Fluttershy and I hung out today, a bit odd considering we had a spa day yesterday, but I'm not complaining. She was still acting a bit off today like yesterday, but not as much.

She was a lot more physical today, she had to have given me a dozen hugs over the day. I wonder if somethings up, I certainly would do anything I can to help her. I love her so much, I dare say she is my best friend, don't tell the others.

We walked around town and before coming back home. she helped me work on a few dresses, she really wanted to help. If I didn't know any better, I'd say she might have a crush on me.

## Day 3: Delay

Dear diary,

Today I asked Rarity to help me around my house, she was happy to do so. When she came out of her house, she was wearing a new hat. She looked so cute in the hat, I wanted to tell her she looked pretty, but didn't have the courage…

## Day 7: Dating

Dear diary,

I did it diary! I asked her out! and she said yes!! I'm so happy, I can't believe I was able to do it. I'm so proud of myself, and so is Rarity. She said she could tell something was up from my different behavior and the fact we hung out literally every day for the past week. I guess I didn't hide it very well.

And, we kissed! It was so amazing. She looked so cute when she blushed. After the kiss we hugged for a really long time, it was just so calming, holding each other. I would still be holding her if we didn't have to stop.

After that she admitted that she was starting to develop feelings for me, isn't that crazy. She asked if I wanted to go on a date, I said yes, immediately. I had so much fun hanging out with her this week, I can only imagine how amazing a date would be.
