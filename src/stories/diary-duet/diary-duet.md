# Diary Duet

## Day one: Discovery

Dear diary,

I think I have a crush on Rarity. Today, at our weekly spa trip, I couldn't stop looking at her. I kept thinking about her, how beautiful she looks, how nice she is, how much I *loved* the hug she gave me.

I don't know what to do, diary… I wanted to panic, but I couldn't help but feel calm around her. She did notice me acting strange, I lied to her, which made me cry when I got home…

Maybe tomorrow we can hang out more. I might get a better grasp over my feelings then, I hope…

## Day two: Difference

Dear diary,

Fluttershy and I hung out today, a bit odd considering we had a spa day yesterday, but I'm not complaining. She was still acting a bit off today like before, but not as much.

She was a lot more physical today, she had to have given me a dozen hugs over the day. I wonder if something's up, I certainly would do anything I can to help her. I love her so much, I dare say she is my best friend, don't tell the others.

We walked around town before coming back home. She helped me work on a few dresses, she really wanted to help. If I didn't know any better, I'd say she might have a crush on me.

## Day three: Delay

Dear diary,

Today I asked Rarity to help me around my house, she said she was happy to do it. When she came out of her house, she was wearing a new hat. She looked really cute in the hat, I wanted to tell her she looked pretty, but I didn't have the courage…

After we were done doing what I needed done, I asked her to help more, even stuff I didn't need help with. I feel bad for tricking her into staying, I just wanted to spend more time with her…

Eventually she had to go home, I felt really lonely with her gone, not even my animals could cheer me up. I just sulked around the house, trying to think of how I was going to deal with these feelings.

## Day four: Divulge

Dear diary,

Today we hung out yet again. We had lunch together, and the whole time she stared at me. After lunch, we went and saw Twilight. Twilight did notice Fluttershy acting different, and asked me about it. I didn't know what to say. We stayed there a while, then Twilight asked if Fluttershy had a crush on me. It surprised me and made me re-evaluate my relationship with Fluttershy.

I am all but certain that Fluttershy has a crush on me. The way she's acting different, the way she stares at me, it's the only conclusion I can come too. To tell you the truth, I don't know how to feel about it, sure I love her as a friend, but could I develop feelings for her? This is something I'm going to have to think about, and to divulge one of my thoughts so far, I do think Fluttershy is rather cute.

## Day five: Decide

Dear diary,

I tried again today to tell Rarity that she is pretty, I was so close. I'm going to try again tomorrow, wish me luck. I've also decided that I am going to ask her out, it just might take a day or two to build up the courage. I really hope she says yes.

We hung out at her house again, we worked on dresses and I offered to make us lunch, it was really nice. I kept hugging her a lot, I couldn't help myself, her hugs just feel amazing.

She looked really cute when she was eating, it almost made me blush. I made us pancakes. I feel bad sometimes for taking up so much of her time, but she never complained. Could that mean she likes me back? I wish… I held our last hug long, it was really delightful.

## Day six: Daydream

Dear diary,

Today, Fluttershy told me I was pretty. It caught me off guard, making be blush hard. I did my best to hide my face, I don't think she saw. After that I had this desire to kiss her, I couldn't stop thinking about it, and how cute she looked.

We didn't do much today of any substance, mostly just talking, walking around town, and we continued the newfound tradition of hugging a dozen times. I'm not complaining, she gives the best hugs, don't tell Pinkie. I've absolutely loved hanging out with her.

After she left, I started daydreaming about us being in a relationship, and I think I want it too. I just don't think Fluttershy can ask me out, but maybe I'm wrong, she did tell me I was pretty. If she doesn't ask me out tomorrow, I'll ask her out at our spa visit in two days.

## Day seven: Dating

Dear diary,

I did it, diary! I asked her out! And she said yes!! I'm so happy, I can't believe I was able to do it. I'm so proud of myself, and so is Rarity. She said she could tell something was up from my different behavior and the fact we hung out literally every day for the past week. I guess I didn't hide it very well.

Also, we kissed! It was so amazing. She looked so cute when she blushed. After the kiss, we hugged for a really long time, it was just so calming, holding each other. I would still be holding her if we didn't have to stop.

After that, she admitted that she was starting to develop feelings for me, isn't that crazy. We talked for a long time after that, she said she really enjoyed my hugs, that made me blush really hard. I'm excited to be dating my best friend. I can't wait for our spa day tomorrow.
