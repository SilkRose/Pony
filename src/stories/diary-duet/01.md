Day 1: Brave New World

*Dear diary*

*I'M IN A LAND OF MAGICAL TALKING PONIES! So I should probably start from the beginning. I went to bed last night and woke up in a strange new world. I was in a field of apple trees. I didn't know where I was or where to go so I headed to a barn I saw in the distance. I was not ready for what awaited me there, it was an orange talking magical horse... Or pony as they like to be called. And we could understand each other. She introduced herself as Applejack and said she was glad to meet me. I was not sure if I was on drugs or dead, all I could say was ‘whats going on? where am I?’ She answered, saying I was at Sweet Apple Acres and that she didn't know where I came from or how I got there. Once I calmed down, we talked for a bit and she recommended I talk to her friend Twilight Sparkle, a magical magical talking horse pony thing. Applejack leads me through town to a giant castle thing, from the outside It looked more like a child’s toy than a castle. She introduced me and left to finish her chores. Twilight and I talked for hours about where I came from and where I am now. She said she would try and help me get home. That makes me feel better. She suggested I start writing in a diary to keep my thoughts in order, so now I have you. She said this place is called Equestria, and this town is called Ponyville. She said I could stay with her for now. She offered to show me the town, but before we got out the door one of her friends shows up, a pink pony named Pinkie Pie. this new pony had no idea what personal space was and decided to sing me a ‘welcome to Ponyville’ song. Twilight told her what we were doing and Pinkie Pie asks if she can show me the town instead, and Twilight agreed, assuring me Pinkie was a good guide.*

Day 2: Fur-less Fun New Friend

*Dear diary*

*I met a new friend today! Twilight was showing a new guy in town, ya know the town and they came to Sugarcube Corner. He is not a pony, he is a human he said. I don't know what that is, but humans are tall and don’t have any fur. He said his name was Anon. I told him he needs a welcome party and he didn't understand why. Everypony needs a welcome party, duh! I gave him a welcome to Ponyville hug and he started tearing up… He hugged me tighter and wiped away the tears. He apologized and I told him he didn't need to. He tried to explain it but I shushed him, I already knew, auntie Pinkie Pie always knows. Twilight didn't know about the tears and I decided it was Anon’s decision if he wanted to say. When the hug was over he whispered thank you in my ear. I smiled at them and they left soon after. I sure hope his welcome to Ponyville party tomorrow does him some good, sure looks like he needs it. I’ll let you know what happens tomorrow.*

Day 2: Pretty Pink Pony

*Dear diary*

*Today Twilight took me around town to show me around. The first stop was at a place called Sugarcube Corner. It was an interesting encounter, there we met a pink earth pony named Pinkie Pie. She sure was an interesting character, so full of energy and life, I wish I was more like her. She said she wanted to throw me a welcome to Ponyville party. I told her it wasn't necessary, I think she's going to do it anyway. When we were about to leave she gave me a hug and.. and I just started tearing up,  It was the first time in a while I’d had physical contact with another person, and it was a cute and soft pony. I guess I needed it and she could tell, she let the hug go on for as long as I wanted. When it was over, as I was pulling away I whispered thank you in her ear. Twilight had a puzzled look on her face, I didn't want to talk about it so we left after saying goodbye to Pinkie Pie.*
