### Synopsis

A guy gets sent to Equestria. The story switches between his diary and pinkie pieâ€™s diary, and they fall in love over time.

### Description


### Short Description


### Ideas

- Story takes place over a month, 31 days.
- Each day contains 2 entries, one from Pinkie, one from Anon.
- Over time Anon becomes equated with Equestria.
- Anon and Pinkie become friends and by the end have feelings for each other.
- Typical diary entries are one big paragraph but I want to make it more readable.
- Anon and Pinkie have different dynamics, Anon's entries are more detail oriented, Pinkie's entries are more sporadic and emotional.
- Anon has trouble sleeping the first night, meets spike while walking the halls, they bond.
- The last entry for each is addressed to each other instead of to the diary.
