# Diary Duet

Mane Characters: 

Location: 

### Synopsis

A human (Joshua Richards) gets sent to Equestria. The story switches between his diary and pinkie pie's diary, and they fall in love over time.

### Description


### Short Description


### Ideas

- Story takes place over a month, 31 days.
- Each day contains 2 entries, one from Pinkie, one from Josh.
- Over time Josh becomes equated with Equestria.
- Josh and Pinkie become friends and by the end have feelings for each other.
- Typical diary entries are one big paragraph but I want to make it more readable.
- Josh and Pinkie have different dynamics, Josh's entries are more detail oriented, Pinkie's entries are more sporadic and emotional.
- Josh has trouble sleeping the first night, meets spike while walking the halls, they bond.
- Epilogue is a letter from each addressed to each other instead of to the diary.
- Include P.S.'s in his diary written by Pinkie, with her comments on some of his entries. And in the epilogue it is revealed that with his letter he sent her his diary.

#### Sequel Idea
They stop writing in their diaries and instead write each other a letter every day.
name: Love Letters

#### Cover changes
 - Cover updates everyday, adding a new tick to his diary cover.
 - 4 times throughout the story the cover gets a small change:
   7. Pinkie gives him her pink pen when he loses his, the pen moving from her side to his.
   16. He had a sentimental item with him, a card, coin, a dice, something and gives it to her. It moves from his side to hers.
   26. Pinkie gives him the heart sticker from her diary as a hint. He puts it on his own diary.
   32. Letter appears for epilogue, to the right of Pinkie's diary.
