# Chapter 2: Underground

I try again to grab the cloth flap of the saddlebag to no avail.

I stop jumping. *There has to be some way out of this mess. Maybe I could see what's under the trampoline?*

I move to the edge of the trampoline. Moving the blue protection flap off of the springs to get a better look at them. Just regular trampoline springs that I've removed hundreds of times. I remove a few of them and set them on the blue flap, so I don't lose them.

*I hope there's something down there.* I take the plunge and slowly lift myself below the trampoline, feet first.

To my surprise, only a few feet down I hit something hard, the floor. I descend all the way onto the floor. Once I'm on the floor, I feel it, it's dirt.

I decide to venture around on the floor looking for anything that would be of use. I don't have to look far, as in the center of the dirt ground is a small wooden frame built into the ground. *What do we have here?*

It's dark down here, so I mostly have to feel around it, on one side I can feel some hinges and on the other side, I can feel a handle. Not being brain surgery, I determine it is a door that leads somewhere. I open it and shield my eyes, not used to the amount of light that lay beyond.

Down the hatch is well lit. *thank god.* There is a ladder that leads down to a hallway. Having nothing better to do, I go down it.

Once I'm down the ladder, I look around the hallway. It's made of light gray stone and had an arched top running along its entire length. It was well lit somehow, I don't see any light sources. There was a purple carpet running down it to where it dead-ended at the ladder I just came down.

I walk down the hallway. *What is this place? Why is it under a trampoline linked to a saddlebag? How is this even real? Am I in a coma? Where does this lead?*

I find the answer to that last question in a short time as I come up to a door.

The door was shaped like the hallway with the arched top. It was made of wood and had no windows. The only thing giving it away as a door is the door handle on the right side.

I walk up to the door and turn the handle cautiously and pull it towards me slowly. On the other side to the left was another door just like it and to the right was a hallway like the one I had traveled down. *How big is this place?*

I walk through the door and decide to see what's behind the door to my left. Opening it reveals a hallway. *I should have seen that coming.*

I walk down it, the trip to the end was as boring as the first hallway. At the end was a ladder just like the first one. I go up it and open the door on the hatch and climb onto the ground. Yep, just like where I just was.

I go over to the side of the room and remove some springs, climbing up on the trampoline it hits me. *This must be the purple one's other saddlebag.* This bag is different however, on the trampoline is a pile of books and scrolls.

I sift through it; a book on how to climb a mountain, a book on dragon fire, a map of the area surrounding Ponyville. *Basically all useless to me while I'm stuck in here.*

I push it to the edge of the trampoline and jump.

Boing

I see the orange pony running next to me in the opposite direction I was used to. Man, they sure can run, I've been down there for a while.

Boing

Out of the corner of my right eye, I see the same hair from the other saddlebag flailing in the wind. *That confirms it, I'm in her other saddlebag. Why do these 2 hallways lead to weird trampoline rooms linked to this pony's saddlebags? Now I'm even more curious about where that hallway leads.*

Boing

AAH, Pinkie was staring at me with that same worried face, this time a lot closer. *Where did she come from?* I stop jumping from that near heart attack.

I decide to go see where that hallway leads, hopefully, a way out of here.

I go over to the edge and clamber under the trampoline, then crawl over to the ladder and go down it. I walk down the hallway at a brisk pace.

Once I get to the door, I go through it and close it behind me. I walk down the previously unexplored hallway. *If I'm lucky, this will lead out of this crazy place.*

The hallway is the same as the last two. At the end of the hallway is a door, like the last two made of wood, but this one had a symbol on it, a pink six-pointed star with a smaller white six pointed star behind it slightly rotated, and five smaller six pointed stars around that.

I open it, on the other side is a six sided room with five more doors just like the one I came through with different symbols. From left to right it went; The door I came from, A door with three apples on it. A door with three butterflies on it. A door with three balloons on it. A door with a cloud with a rainbow lightning bolt coming out of it. A door with three diamonds on it.

*I know I've seen these symbols before, but where?*
