# A Hug and a Kiss

I open the door to Pinkie's room and trot inside.

"Hi, Dashie," Pinkie says to me.

"Hey, I'm bored, wanna do something?"

"Yes, and I have just the thing."

"What?"

"A contest!"

"Oh, sounds exciting, what kind?"

"Hugging."

"Hugging?" I ask, confused.

"Yea, we hug and last one to let go wins."

*Seriously?*

"What are the stakes," I say in a disinterested tone.

"Winner gets anything they want from the loser."

"Anything?" I say as ideas of stuff I could make Pinkie do enter my mind.

*I could make her do a funny prank.*

*I could make her buy me cider.*

"Anything."

"Okay, I'm in."

Pinkie trots over to me and gives me a hug.

I hug back as I realize what I just agreed too.

*So, this is my life now.*

As we hug, I cant help but notice how soft Pinkie is.

*I guess our normal hugs don't last long enough to notice.*

Pinkie comments, "This is nice."

I agree, surprisingly. "Yep."

A few minutes into the hug I don't know what to do. "So, what now?"

"What do you wanna do?"

*I don't know, maybe we can go see a friend?*

"Let's go see Twilight."

"Okay, let's go."

With that we shamble to the door, opening it slowly.

*This is going to be a rough day…*

***

Twilight opens the door, or at least I think it's Twilight, Pinkie is facing the door at the moment.

"Hi, girls?" Twilight says from behind me.

"Can we come in?" Pinkie asks.

"Sure," Twilight says in a confused tone.

We shuffle into her tree house.

"Go for the couch, Pinkie, I need to sit down," I say.

We make our way to her couch and sit down. I breath a sigh of relief.

*Phew.*

"What are you two doing?" Twilight asked.

I explain, "Me and Pinkie are seeing who can hug the longest. We just came from her house."

"Oh, interesting. Why are you doing this?"

"I like winning."

"Okay."

"You should have seen the stares we got on the way over, it was like they thought we were a couple," I say before laughing.

I can feel Pinkie nod her head. Twilight moves over to Pinkie, where I can't see.

I rest my head on Pinkie's back.

*Pinkie makes a good pillow; so soft.*

Pinkie nuzzles my neck.

*Why'd she do that?*

I don't get an answer, probably because I didn't as a question.

I can hear Twilight moving something around before I hear chalk on a chalkboard.

Seconds later I feel Pinkie nod.

"What's going on?" I ask.

"I'm talking to Pinkie, in private. Sorry," Twilight says.

They go on for a couple minutes, having a conversation I'm not allowed in.

*Boo.*

*If they're going to exclude me, I might as well take a nap.*

I close my eyes and nuzzle Pinkie's back, holding her tight, I fall asleep.

***

I wake up sometime later. I can feel Pinkie's head resting on my back.

*She might have took a nap too.*

Looking around, I don't see Twilight.

"Twilight," I call for her.

Moments later, Twilight comes from downstairs. "Yes?" She says as she approaches the couch.

"Is Pinkie asleep?"

"Yes, I believe so."

"How long have we been asleep?"

"About an hour."

"Okay, thanks for letting up nap here."

"You're welcome, can we talk before you wake Pinkie up?"

"Sure, what's up?"

"I know you laughed it off earlier, but have you considered a relationship with Pinkie?"

*Date Pinkie?*

"Like a romantic one?"

"Yes."

"No, I haven't, why?"

"I think it's something you should think about."

"Do you think Pinkie likes me?"

"I don't know, but she seemed really excited about you two being closer from this."

"Okay, I'll think it through."

"Thank you, for her sake."

I lay my head back down on Pinkie as I think.

*Date Pinkie? That's a big question…*

*I mean sure, I've enjoyed* most *of the time I've spent holding her today, but dating is a lot more serious of a consideration.*

*I guess I got plenty of time to think about it.*

I decide to put it off till later. Thinking about dating your best friend is a daunting task, okay?

I nudge Pinkie with my head, trying to wake her. "Pinkie?"

She doesn't respond. I try again. "Pinkie?"

She starts to wake up, I feel her start to remove her forelegs from around me.

"Stop!" I shout.

Pinkie freezes as I feel her tense up. A moment later she relaxes. "thanks."

"You're welcome."

*I guess I wasn't ready to stop hugging her.*

"Have a good nap?"

"Yes, I had a nice and soft pillow."

"Me too," Pinkie says as I can hear the blush in her voice.

"Where should we go now? It would be rude and probably boring to stay on Twilight's couch all day."

Pinkie takes a few seconds to think, eventually she says, "Let's go see Rarity."

*Oh, great…*

"Okay, but I'm walking forward this time."

"Okay."

We say goodbye to Twilight and manage to leave her house.

***

Rarity opens the door with a smile, once she's seen us, her smiles grows wider.

*Here we go.*

I lead us inside, walking past Rarity. I walk us to the couch, where we sit down.

Rarity says, "I must say, you two look positively adorable together."

I was about to say something when Pinkie spoke, "Thank you."

Rarity asked, "Is this some way of telling me you two are dating or something?"

I lay my head on Pinkie's back, defeated.

*Is everypony going to mention something about us dating?*

Pinkie explains, "We're having a hugging contest, to see who can hold a hug the longest."

"Oh, okay."

I stop paying attention to there conversation as I try and enjoy Pinkie's embrace.

I close my eyes and start to think.

*That's two ponies who mentioned it, next thing you know, Fluttershy is going to tell me to kiss her.*

*I don't know what to do, it sure seems like our friends want us to get together, or at least half of them do so far.*

*I guess now is a good time to think about dating Pinkie.*

*So, Pinkie Pie.*

*She's definitely soft.*

Without thinking about it, I nuzzle Pinkie's back, reaffirming her softness.

*She's really pretty.*

*Beautiful, beautiful is what she is.*

*So, I think my best friend is hot, that doesn't mean anything, right?*

Rarity interrupts my thought process, making me suddenly aware of the blush intensifying on my face. "Rainbow, are you alright? Your face is rather flush."

My stomach grumbles as I find my excuse. "I'm hungry, could you feed us?"

*Nice save.*

"Absolutely, darling, come on into the kitchen," Rarity says before leading up into the kitchen.

We sit down in two chairs placed beside each other.

I sigh as I realize what I have to ask.

"Rarity, can you spoon feed us? We can't let go to eat…"

I could hear the excitement in her voice. "Yes."

Pinkie asks, "Do you have any peas and carrots?"

*That actually sounds kinda good right now.*

Rarity answers, "Yes, is that what you want too, Rainbow?"

"Sure."

Rarity gets the food out, going to Pinkie first. "Here comes the choo-choo train."

*This is so embarrassing…*

Pinkie excitedly goes with it. "Yay."

Rarity says, "Chugga chugga choo choo," as I can hear her feed Pinkie.

Rarity walks over to me with the food.

I deflate her fun. "No, if you do it, I am leaving."

"You're no fun."

"If you want fun, have it with Pinkie."

Rarity relents, "Okay."

Rarity feeds me quietly before going back to Pinkie.

With each round of food, I think of a new thought.

*I wonder what I should pick when I win.*

*Maybe I could prank Rarity.*

*Or I could get her to wait in line for me for cider season.*

*I could do something nice for her?*

*Like do whatever she wanted if she won.*

*I wonder what she wants?*

As Rarity comes back to me, I notice she only has one spoon in her magic.

*We've been sharing a spoon.*

The thought makes me blush.

Rarity notices. "Rainbow, are you sure you're alright? Your face is red again."

I decide we need to have a chat. "Rarity, can we talk, in private?"

"Sure," Rarity says before she goes in the other room for a moment, coming back with some black cloth.

Rarity levitates it over to Pinkie. "Pinkie, I need to talk with Rainbow, is it okay if I cover your head for privacy?"

"Okay," Pinkie says.

Rarity covers Pinkie's head with the fabric.

She comes over to me and whispers, "It's sound deadening, if we whisper she won't be able to hear."

"Okay," I whisper.

"What's going on?"

"I think Pinkie has a crush on me."

"Oh, do you like her back?"

"I don't know, I'm conflicted."

"What about? If I may ask."

"Everything, this contest, the hug, my feelings. It's all so overwhelming, and when I start to think about how I feel about her, I accidentally blush and get interrupted."

"Well, if it's making you blush, then, there is something there, wouldn't you say?"

"Yes, but how do I know that isn't just from hugging her for hours straight?"

"How have you liked hugging her so far?"

"To be honest, way more than I expected."

"Pinkie has blushed more than you since you've been here."

"Why didn't you say anything about her blushing?"

"It's more fun to tease you."

"Thanks…"

"Sorry."

"What should I do?"

"Follow your heart."

"What does that mean? I don't know what to think with all these emotions in my head. Pinkie is my best friend and I love her more than anything. I think she's more beautiful than even you. Sorry, no offence. I can't think straight when all I wanna do is hug her and not let go."

Rarity throws me a curve ball. "What do you want from winning?"

"I don't know, I had thought about making her do a prank, or buy me cider."

"What do you think Pinkie wants from winning?"

"I don't know, but from what Twilight said, she might want *me*, like to date me, or to kiss me."

"Think about you and Pinkie kissing."

I try and imagine us kissing.

*I bet her lips would be so soft.*

*She would be a good kisser.*

*I… wound't mind kissing her.*

I can feel a blush forming again on my face.

"Did it go well?" Rarity asks with a smile.

"Yes."

"I think we're done here. I would recommend considering Pinkie's feelings when choosing your prize if you win."

"Okay," I say. "I would give you a hug if I could, thank you."

Rarity hugs me. "You're welcome, darling."

After the hug, Rarity pulls the fabric off Pinkie. "Sorry it took so long, darling."

"It's alright," Pinkie says.

Rarity asks us, "Do either of you want more food?"

Pinkie answers, "No, I'm good."

"I'm full," I say.

"You two are welcome, to stay for as long as you want, my couch is always free."

"We've burdened you enough. Do you wanna go see Fluttershy?" I ask Pinkie.

"Sure."

We say our goodbyes to Rarity and leave her abode.
