# A Hug and a Kiss

I open the door to Pinkie's room and trot inside.

"Hi, Dashie," Pinkie says to me.

"Hey, I'm bored, wanna do something?"

"Yes, and I have just the thing."

"What?"

"A contest!"

"Oh, sounds exciting, what kind?"

"Hugging."

"Hugging?" I ask, confused.

"Yea, we hug and last one to let go wins."

*Seriously?*

"What are the stakes," I say in a disinterested tone.

"Winner gets anything they want from the loser."

"Anything?" I say as ideas of stuff I could make Pinkie do enter my mind.

*I could make her do a funny prank.*

*I could make her buy me cider.*

"Anything."

"Okay, I'm in."

Pinkie trots over to me and gives me a hug.

I hug back as I realize what I just agreed too.

*So, this is my life now.*

As we hug, I cant help but notice how soft Pinkie is.

*I guess our normal hugs don't last long enough to notice.*

Pinkie comments, "This is nice."

I agree, surprisingly. "Yep."

A few minutes into the hug I don't know what to do. "So, what now?"

"What do you wanna do?"

*I don't know, maybe we can go see a friend?*

"Let's go see Twilight."

"Okay, let's go."

With that we shamble to the door, opening it slowly.

*This is going to be a rough day…*

***

Twilight opens the door, or at least I think it's Twilight, Pinkie is facing the door at the moment.

"Hi, girls?" Twilight says from behind me.

"Can we come in?" Pinkie asks.

"Sure," Twilight says in a confused tone.

We shuffle into her tree house.

"Go for the couch, Pinkie, I need to sit down," I say.

We make our way to her couch and sit down. I breath a sigh of relief.

*Phew.*

"What are you two doing?" Twilight asked.

I explain, "Me and Pinkie are seeing who can hug the longest. We just came from her house."

"Oh, interesting. Why are you doing this?"

"I like winning."

"Okay."

"You should have seen the stares we got on the way over, it was like they thought we were a couple," I say before laughing.

I can feel Pinkie nod her head. Twilight moves over to Pinkie, where I can't see.

I rest my head on Pinkie's back.

*Pinkie makes a good pillow; so soft.*

Pinkie nuzzles my neck.

*Why'd she do that?*

I don't get an answer, probably because I didn't as a question.

I can hear Twilight moving something around before I hear chalk on a chalkboard.

Seconds later I feel Pinkie nod.

"What's going on?" I ask.

"I'm talking to Pinkie, in private. Sorry," Twilight says.

They go on for a couple minutes, having a conversation I'm not allowed in.

*Boo.*

*If they're going to exclude me, I might as well take a nap.*

I close my eyes and nuzzle Pinkie's back, holding her tight, I fall asleep.

***

I wake up sometime later. I can feel Pinkie's head resting on my back.

*She might have took a nap too.*

Looking around, I don't see Twilight.

"Twilight," I call for her.

Moments later, Twilight comes from downstairs. "Yes?" She says as she approaches the couch.

"Is Pinkie asleep?"

"Yes, I believe so."

"How long have we been asleep?"

"About an hour."

"Okay, thanks for letting up nap here."

"You're welcome, can we talk before you wake Pinkie up?"

"Sure, what's up?"

"I know you laughed it off earlier, but have you considered a relationship with Pinkie?"

*Date Pinkie?*

"Like a romantic one?"

"Yes."

"No, I haven't, why?"

"I think it's something you should think about."

"Do you think Pinkie likes me?"

"I don't know, but she seemed really excited about you two being closer from this."

"Okay, I'll think it through."

"Thank you, for her sake."

I lay my head back down on Pinkie as I think.

*Date Pinkie? That's a big question…*
