# Best of Seventy-One

I sit down as we wait for Applejack to arrive with Fluttershy.

Looking around, I see Pinkie walking towards me.

Pinkie sits down in front of me, asking, "Hey Rarity, wanna play tic-tac-toe?"

I tilt my head curiously.

Pinkie explains, "I was bored and saw you sitting all alone."

*Should help pass the time.*

"Sure, darling."

"Woo-hoo!"

"This could be fun."

"Anything I do with my friends is fun!"

I smile at her, and she smiles back.

I look around me, finding a stick. I levitate the stick over and mark a tic-tac-toe board in the dirt between us.

"Would you like to go first, darling, since it was your idea?"

"Sure," Pinkie says before doing exactly what Pinkie would do, using her nose to mark an O on the middle square of the board.

*Why is she using her nose?*

Pinkie looks up at me expectantly, like she hadn't just committed a crime against cleanliness.
