# Best of Seventy-One

I sit down as we wait for Applejack to arrive with Fluttershy.

Looking around, I see Pinkie walking towards me.

Pinkie sits down in front of me, asking, "Hey Rarity, wanna play tic-tac-toe?"

I tilt my head curiously.

Pinkie explains, "I was bored and saw you sitting all alone."

*Should help pass the time.*

"Sure, darling."

"Woo-hoo!"

"This could be fun."

"Anything I do with my friends is fun!"

I smile at her, and she smiles back.

I look around me, finding a stick. I levitate the stick over and mark a tic-tac-toe board in the dirt between us.

"Would you like to go first, darling, since it was your idea?"

"Sure," Pinkie says before doing exactly what Pinkie would do, using her nose to mark an O on the middle square of the board.

*Why is she using her nose?*

Pinkie looks up at me expectantly, like she hadn't just committed a crime against cleanliness.

I use my stick to mark an X on the top left of the board.

Pinkie marks an O to the right of my X, still using her nose.

*How can she be so flippant about her nose's cleanliness?*

I mark my X without looking at the board, fixated on Pinkie's nose.

Pinkie places her third O in a row, winning the first game. "I win!"

"You did great," I say as I stare at her nose.

*Maybe she would let me clean it off?*

I draw the next board as I try to ignore her nose.

Pinkie goes first again and with each play, I think.

*Why am I so stuck on her nose?*

*It is unsanitary.*

*You would think that would hurt.*

*She doesn't seem to mind at all.*

*I mind, I want to clean it.*

Pinkie looks at me and I realize I hadn't played my turn.

"Sorry, darling," I say before marking my X.

Pinkie marks her O, winning the game. "You seem distracted, is something on your mind?"

"I'm fine, just a lot on my mind."

*Stop staring at her nose.*

"Okay."

I mark the next board on the ground and Pinkie goes first again.

I stop staring at her nose, only to notice her smile. I smile back as it infects me.

*Her smile is so genuine.*

*So beautiful.*

*So her.*

*So cute.*

I feel a light blush forming on my face.

*Where did that come from?*

*Did her smile just get bigger?*

Pinkie wins the third game. I mark the next board and reassure myself.

*You must stop staring at Pinkie.*

I look back up and swear I can see the faintest of blushes on her face.

*That's real, right?*

I mark my X and get lost in her smile again.

*Why am I looking at her smile again?*

*I don't know… but I can't seem to stop.*

*It's gorgeous… like her.*

*I wonder what her lips taste like.*

Pinkie wins again before I can continue my train of thought.

*Probably better I don't continue thinking such things…*

I mark a new board as we move over to it.

Pinkie goes first again as I once again get fascinated by a new facet of my friend.

*How am I just now realizing how stunningly beautiful Pinkie's blue eyes are?*

I stare into them as I marvel.

*If she stares at me any longer, I'm liable to kiss her here and now.*

She blinks and I shake my head, trying to clear my thoughts.

*What are you thinking, Rarity. Pinkie is your friend.*

I slow my racing thoughts, thinking new thoughts on every set of moves instead of each one.

*I need to pay attention to the game.*

*But her eyes are so pretty.*

Pinkie wins the fifth game.

I mark a new board as I become distraught over her nose again.

*Why can't she just use a stick, her hoof, or just let me do it?*

*Maybe because I haven't asked…*

*I just want to clean it.*

*It bothers me.*

*I'll ask when we are done playing.*

Pinkie wins again.

*How have I not at least accidentally won once already?*

*Pinkie is too good.*

*And too cute…*

I blush and look down to try to hide it.

"Rarity?"

"Yes, darling?"

"What's going on?"

"I'm just distressed about the dragon and all."

"Oh, that's it. I thought you kept loosing because you couldn't stop looking at me and thinking about how pretty I am and how much you wanted to kiss me."

I pick my jaw up and try to play it cool. "Yep, definitely not that."

"Oh, okay."

Pinkie wins again as I reevaluate my life, thoughts slowing to one per lose.

*How does she know?*

*Did she believe me when I said no?*

*Why do I want to kiss her?*

*I think she's beautiful, and I love her smile.*

*Would she want to kiss me?*

*I don't know…*

*Does she know she has cute ears?*

*I bet she'd be nice to cuddle with…*

*She'd make a great pillow.*

*I should probably speak with her about these feelings.*

*I'll do it later, too busy staring.*

*Although, it's not nice to stare.*

*I can't help it, she's so pretty.*

*I want to kiss her.*

*A lot.*

*And hug her.*

*I also would like to clean her nose.*

*Definitely not an excuse to be close to her.*

*I mean, it's not, but I'll take what I can get.*

I do like the idea of being close to her…

*Holding her.*

*Kissing her.*

My blush returns, but I make no attempt to hide it.

*I can't believe I'm wanting to do those things with one of my best friends.*

*I can't blame myself, she's so wonderful.*

*I love her personality.*

*Always making her friends happy.*

*I love the way she looks.*

*She's just so adorable and beautiful at the same time.*

*I just love… her.*

Pinkie wins the thirty-fifth game. "Whoo-hoo! I win again!"

"Ugh. That's thirty-five games in a row. Best of seventy-one?"

I mark the next board as an idea comes to me. "Pinkie, if I win the next game, you let me clean your nose, deal?"

"Deal."

*This is your chance, Rarity.*

I play my best… and win.

*She let me win, didn't she?*

Pinkie leans close to me, presenting her nose.

I clean it with a napkin I have in my bag.

*There, all clean.*

I smile at her and she leans closer.

*What's she doing?*

Pinkie kisses me and wraps her hooves around me.

*Oh, my, darling.*

I'm taken aback before I kiss back, with passion.

*I guess I was pretty obvious, wasn't I?*

I close my eyes and hold her tight.

*If this is our first kiss, I want to make it count.*

I open my eyes and melt, seeing those beautiful blue eyes staring back into mine.

*I love this.*

I break the kiss and say the only thing that I can think of. "I love you."

"I love you too!"
