# Best of Seventy-One

I sit down as we wait for Applejack to arrive with Fluttershy.

Looking around, I see Pinkie walking towards me.

Pinkie sits down in front of me, asking, "Hey Rarity, wanna play tic-tac-toe?"

I tilt my head curiously.

Pinkie explains, "I was bored and saw you sitting all alone."

*Should help pass the time.*

"Sure, darling."

"Woo-hoo!"

"This could be fun."

"Anything I do with my friends is fun!"

I smile at her, and she smiles back.

I look around me, finding a stick. I levitate the stick over and mark a tic-tac-toe board in the dirt between us.

"Would you like to go first, darling, since it was your idea?"

"Sure," Pinkie says before doing exactly what Pinkie would do, using her nose to mark an O on the middle square of the board.

*Why is she using her nose?*

Pinkie looks up at me expectantly, like she hadn't just committed a crime against cleanliness.

I use my stick to mark an X on the top left of the board.

Pinkie marks an O to the right of my X, still using her nose.

*How can she be so flippant about her nose's cleanliness?*

I mark my X without looking at the board, fixated on Pinkie's nose.

Pinkie places her third O in a row, winning the first game. "I win!"

"You did great," I say as I stare at her nose.

*Maybe she would let me clean it off?*

I draw the next board as I try to ignore her nose.

Pinkie goes first again and with each play, I think.

*Why am I so stuck on her nose?*

*It is unsanitary.*

*You would think that would hurt.*

*She doesn't seem to mind at all.*

*I mind, I want to clean it.*

Pinkie looks at me and I realize I hadn't played my turn.

"Sorry, darling," I say before marking my X.

Pinkie marks her O, winning the game. "You seem distracted, is something on your mind?"

"I'm fine, just a lot on my mind."

*Stop staring at her nose.*

"Okay."

I mark the next board on the ground and Pinkie goes first again.

I stop staring at her nose, only to notice her smile. I smile back as it infects me.

*Her smile is so genuine.*

*So beautiful.*

*So her.*

*So cute.*

I feel a light blush forming on my face.

*Where did that come from?*

*Did her smile just get bigger?*

Pinkie wins the third game. I mark the next board and reassure myself.

*You must stop staring at Pinkie.*

I look back up and swear I can see the faintest of blushes on her face.

*That's real, right?*

I mark my X and get lost in her smile again.

*Why am I looking at her smile again?*

*I don't know… but I can't seem to stop.*

*It's gorgeous… like her.*

*I wonder what her lips taste like.*

Pinkie wins again before I can continue my train of thought.

*Probably better I don't continue thinking such things…*

I mark a new board as we move over to it.

Pinkie goes first again as I once again get fascinated by a new facet of my friend.

*How am I just realizing how stunningly beautiful Pinkie's blue eyes are?*

I stare into them as I marvel.
