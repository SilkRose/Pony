I lift my head up from the pillow, looking at the cute blue unicorn laying beside me.

I stare at him for a while, until he notices.

"What?" he says in an embarrassed tone.

I don't answer him, instead I snuggle up to him and lay my head on his chest, holding him tightly.

I close my eyes as he wraps his hooves around me, squeezing gently.

*I love him.*

The rhythmic beating of his heart soothes me.

I gently kiss his chest before getting lost in thought.

*I don't know what I'd do without him.*

*Probably be like before, sad.*

An intrusive thought enters my mind.

*What will you do when he is gone?*

*He won't leave me…*

*That's what he says.*

*I believe him!*

*Then, why are you thinking me?*

*Because, I don't know…*

*Because you're afraid.*

*No…*

*You're afraid that he will leave you, like before, like everypony else.*

*He won't!* I shout in my mind.

I instinctively hold him tighter, not wanting to let go.

He holds me tighter in response and ruffles my mane.

*He's so loving…*

*Haven't you thought that before?*

*He's different… I hope…*

*How do you know? Did he promise like the others?*

*It feels different… he feels different…*

I feel the wetness in my eyes.

*No, don't cry…*

*Yes, cry my little rose, show him who you really are.*

*Shut up! Shut up!*

I feel a few tears slowly falling down my face.

*Why… why do you do this to me?*

*Because it's who you are! You're not happy, and you never will be!*

I try to keep my hooves steady as they shake.

I choke back a sob as I hold him tighter.

He holds me tighter in response, asking, "Silky, are you alright?"

I open my mouth, but no words come out.

He asks again as I clamp my eyes shut.

*Stay calm…*

I focus on his heartbeat, trying to calm down.

He nuzzles the top of my head as the floodgates open.

I start to cry.

*No…*

He holds me tighter. "Silky, what's wrong?"

I can't speak, only tears.

I squeeze him tighter, attempting to signal to him to do the same.

He thankfully picks up and holds me really tight.

*Thank you.*

As I focus on his heartbeat, I speak. "P- promise me…"

He says, "Anything, I'll promise you anything!"

"…you won't leave!"

"I promise you, I will never leave. I will always be here for you."

This calms me down some. "You… mean it?"

"Yes, now what's gotten into you?"

"J- j- just some… intrusive thoughts…"

He squeezes me extra tight. "Well, I'll have you know, I am never going to leave you. Not now, not ever."

"T- thank you."

His words calm me and I open my eyes.

He asks, "Is there anything I can do to make you feel better?"

A thought immediately enters my mind.

*A kiss on the lips…*

The intrusive thought returns for seconds.

*But he doesn't like you like that.*

*But… he still lets me kiss him…*

*He's just pitying you.*

*No!*

*He… loves me…*

*Not the way you want him to.*

*Shut up!*

*He said it himself, he's not looking for romance at this time.*

*So what, if kissing him makes me happy, why should it matter?*

*How does it make him feel?*

*He said it makes him happy to make me happy…*

*And you believed him?*

*Yes…*

*Such a naive pony.*

The tears return like a tidal wave. "C- can… I have… a kiss?"

He holds me extra tight. "Yes, absolutely, you cute silly pretty pony."

His words calm me and I look up at him.

He wears a smile, but I see the worry in his eyes.

*I…*

*I love him!*

I lurch forward, pressing our lips together as tears of molten doubt matte my cheeks.

He wraps his hooves around me more, holding me close.

I wrap my hooves around his head, holding him as we kiss passionately.

*He doesn't like you.*

I break down mid-kiss, crying harder.

I try to bear through it and continue the kiss, but it's gone.

I lay my head on his chest and cry, unable to function.

*What is wrong with me?*

He squeezes me, asking, "What's going on, talk to me, please?"

I cry for a solid minute before being able to compose myself.

"I'm terrified…"

"Of what?"

"You leaving…"

"I would never leave you, not in a million years."

"You say that now, but how can you be so sure you won't feel different in the future?"

"Because, I love you. I love you so much, you make me so happy."

I ask, "I do?"

"Yes, you make me so happy, everything you do does. The way you write, the way you are so cute and pretty, the way you love kisses. There is nothing about you that doesn't make me happy."

"But, what about the kisses, you say you're okay with them because they make me happy, but I'm scarred that you won't be forever."

"I promise you, I will let you kiss me as much as you want, I will kiss you as much as you want. I will always be here for you, kisses and all."

"R- really?"

"Really. I love you and nothing will ever change that. And I mean it, I love seeing you happy, and if it means I have to kiss you a million times to keep you happy, I'll do it."

I lurch forward and hug him tightly.

He hugs back.

"I love you so much!"

"I love you too!"

After the hug, I nuzzle him gently.

"Thank you."

"You're welcome."

I lay my head back down on him, holding him tight.

He says, "I could never leave you, you're too cute and pretty, what else would I have to stare at all day?"

I blush.

He leans down and plants a small kiss on my cheek.

I blush harder, and he kisses me on the lips.

*I love him.*
