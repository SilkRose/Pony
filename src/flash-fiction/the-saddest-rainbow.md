The colors of the rainbow were today associated with something somber, the sonic boom was followed by a crash, straight into the ground like a meteorite.

It called the attention of everypony around, whomever could, started approaching the crash site, led by morbid curiosity.

Some scattered pages fell from the sky, some type of journal, handwritten. 
Gathering them, somepony said, "It belongs to a Filly or a Foal, who almost drowned", he kept reading and picking up the other pieces of it, some drawings, piecing together more of the somber puzzle.

No Filly or Foal flown like that, He thought, it was a grown pony who crashed.

He kept reading:

> Dear Diary,
>
> Pain, life is pain. I can't even cry anymore, I just lay on the floor and clench my stomach as it hurts really bad.
>
> I tried talking to Sweetie Belle and Applebloom, but neither of them want anything to do with me.
>
> Guess I'm a loner again.
>
> Maybe I can try to talk to Rainbow again?
>
> It's the only hope I have left.

Shivering, he reached for the other piece of paper:

> Sweetie Belle now also doesn't want to be my friend. What is wrong with me?
>
> How do I constantly screw everything up?
>
> It's not my fault I broke down at her sleepover, I just couldn't handle it…
>
> Something about seeing Rarity be so attentive and nice.
>
> I don't know what to do anymore.

Looking around, he found some more, the front and back covers, with a few drawings, now all defaced, scribbled over, vandalized.

Approaching and looking for more, before the wind dragged them away, he took yet another, reading, and galloping in a rush to the epicenter of the impact.

He read the diary once again, in disbelief he read as he saw what was left on the ground, with rainbow mane and tail, tainted with blood:

> I hate Rainbow Dash, hate, hate, hate, hate her!
>
> I tried talking to her today, about maybe being her sister… She said no…
>
> I broke down crying right there. Then she called me weird for crying. I tried to explain myself, but she didn't want to hear anything.
>
> I'm just done. I don't want to cry anymore, I don't want to have hope anymore, it's too painful. I just want to go away.
>
> This is goodbye, from Scootaloo, forever.
>
> ~Scootaloo
