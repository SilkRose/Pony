# Equal Breeze

Zephyr looks down at his little sister, playing in the clouds.

*Such a wonderful pony, how did I get a sister so great?*

Fluttershy looks up at him, a warm smile on her face.

*What are you thinking about, sis?*

He didn't have to wait long, as she weakly flew to him.

"Zephyr, can you please give me a pony-back ride? I'm too scared to fly where the clouds are gone…"

Zephyr smiles at her. "Sure thing, anything for my little sis."

Fluttershy jumps up and down in excitement, before going over to her brother and clambering onto his back.

"Ready?" Zephyr asks.

"Ready!"

Zephyr does a count-down.

"Three.

"Two.

"One."

He takes off, leaping into the air, wings spread wide.

"Weeeeeeee," Fluttershy says in excitement.

He flies gently with her on his back, taking corners slow and not doing any fancy tricks.

Fluttershy pokes the back of his head.

"What are you doing, sis?"

"Contwoling you."

"Oh."

Fluttershy pokes him again, this time he flies in the direction of the poke.

They fly all around the outskirts of Cloudsdale, reveling in the beautiful day as the wind streaks through their manes.

"Weeeeeeeee," Fluttershy says again, poking her brother to do another turn.

They fly for a few minutes before landing safely back down on the clouds.

"That was so much fun," Fluttershy said.

"It sure was."

"Can we do it again?" Fluttershy asks with pleading eyes.

A third pony steps out from behind a pillar, a colt the same age as Fluttershy that neither knew.

The colt approaches them and asks, "Can I have a turn?"

Fluttershy hides behind Zephyr, wary of this new colt.

Zephyr asks Fluttershy, "Would you be okay with staying her while I fly him around?"

Fluttershy meekly shook her head no.

"Why not?" he asked.

Fluttershy steps up to her brother and whispers in his ear, "But you're my brother, not his."

"Just because he's not family, doesn't mean we don't show him a little kindness."

Fluttershy once again whispers, "But, what if I'm scared?"

Zephyr reassures her, "I'll be watching you from above the whole time, I'll make sure you are safe."

Fluttershy relents, "Okay, but don't take as long, I wanna go again."

Zephyr says, "You'll get another turn, there's plenty of Breeze to go around."

Fluttershy pouts.

"Hey, didn't mom and dad ever teach you about sharing."

Fluttershy just continues to pout.

"It's this magical thing where you have something amazing, and you share it with someone else, so they can also experience that magical thing."

Fluttershy doesn't seem swayed much.

"Listen, you remember how much fun it was up there, right?"

Fluttershy nods.

"Don't you think that colt would have just as much fun?"

Fluttershy says, "Maybe."

"If you were him, would you want to go up there?"

"Yes."

"And wouldn't you want it to last as long as possible?"

"Yes…"

"So, say it with me!"

Fluttershy and Zephyr say, "There's enough Breeze to go around."

Fluttershy chuckles at his silly catchphrase.

Zephyr asks, "So, you will be fine down here while I give him a ride?"

"Yes," Fluttershy says before hugging her brother.

"That's my sister, gentle and kind."

Zephyr helped the colt get on his back and did the same count-down as with Fluttershy.

"Three.

"Two.

"One."

The two took off into the air and flew around the air above where Fluttershy was.

Fluttershy sat patiently, watching her brother with a smile.

*I love you, big brother.*
