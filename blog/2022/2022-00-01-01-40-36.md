# Sequel in progress

The sequel to Pretty and Pink is over halfway done, so far I am really liking how it's turning out.  
My goal is to have it released by February 14th, Hearts & Hooves day.  
Also, I have new art being made for Pretty and Pink, I plan to add it on the same day I release the sequel.  
I also am planning on going back to Pretty and Pink to improve it if I can.
