# Darling and Date Story Update 9

Chapter 4 is at 1k words now. Haven't written much as I've mostly been proofreading chapter 1, 2, 3, and the epilogue.  
Now that I'm done with this round of proofreading, I'm going to focus on writing chapter 4.  
Also planning on proofreading all my currently published stories and updating them soon.

Thanks again all.
