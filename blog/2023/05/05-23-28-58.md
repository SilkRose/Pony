# Darling and Date Story Update 8

The epilogue is done! It's almost 2k words long, it's really sweet, and I love the ending so much.  
I can't wait to release this story, I'm so excited! All that is left to write is chapter 4.  
I had a friend proofread chapter one, they found quite a few grammatical mistakes.  
I've learned a lot from them. I'm probably going to take a day or two break, then proofread chapter 2 and 3 with the new knowledge I've learned.  
After that, I will start on chapter 4.

Thanks for being patient.
