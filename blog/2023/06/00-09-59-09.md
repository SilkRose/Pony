# A Hug and a Kiss

New story is out, I hope you like it!

Darling and Date chapter 1 is fully proofread, going to try to do one a day.  
Will be releasing next week on the 24th.

Sleeping Arrangements has a new cover, made by me.

I have made good progress on the story I plan to release on the 30th, the cover is done too.

Wrote another 1000-word story, this one is a lot different from my usual work. Should be releasing later this week.

Thanks again!
