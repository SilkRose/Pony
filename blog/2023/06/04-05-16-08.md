# Darling and Date Story Update 12

I just finished proofreading all of Darling and Date with the LanguageTool plugin for Obsidian.  
I'm going to story proofread it next, and my friend still needs to read it over.  
The story is over 28k words, it's my longest story yet. I'm proud of it.

The one shot releasing next week is done, written and proofread, just waiting for my friend to read it over.

Thanks for enjoying my work!
