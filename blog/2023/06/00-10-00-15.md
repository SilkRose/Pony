# The Heist of My Heart

Just released that short story I was talking about in my last blog post. I hope you like it.  
Chapter 4 of Darling and Date is at 3.5k words, making good progress.  
Something I forgot to say in the last blog post: I finished proofreading all my published SFW stories and have updated them on FIM Fiction.

Feedback on this short story is much appreciated.
