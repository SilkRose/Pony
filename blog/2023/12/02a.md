# Twilight & Pinkie Romance Story Update 1

I'm sorry that I wasn't able to get my next story about by the end of last month.  
It should be out within the first half of December. I've made a lot of progress on it.  
I wrote 1,400 words yesterday, 1,800 words the day before, and 450 words the day before that.  
I'm very close to the end, and I'm really excited about this story, I can't wait to share it!

Thanks for being patient, stay safe everypony!
