# Darling and Date

Darling and Date is completely published! I'm really proud of it and hope you all enjoy it.

As for what is coming next, I'm going to continue the one story a week trajectory I was on at the start of July.

I have at least six stories in various states of completion I'm working on.

Thanks, all.
