# Peace Attempts and Panic Attacks

Peace Attempts and Panic Attacks has been released. I wish it were doing better, but what can you do but try again!

Darling and Date chapter one is coming out tomorrow! All of it is proofread and will be released Monday to Friday. I'm very excited about this release, I've been working on this story for a long time.

I intend to release two more 1000-word stories for [A Thousand Words Contest II](https://www.fimfiction.net/group/216361/a-thousand-words/thread/517645/a-thousand-words-contest-ii-2023-may-29-jul-30).

The Pink Tax now has a [reading](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DTLq1e9NXk) done by [StraightToThePointStudio](https://www.youtube.com/@StraightToThePointStudio).
