# The Pink Tax

I'm delighted that The Pink Tax was received so well, thank you for getting it featured!

Also, thank you to everyone who helped get The Heist of My Heart, and A Hug and a Kiss featured as well.

Darling and Date just needs chapter 4 proofread, and I plan to do that tomorrow.

I have a few more stories ready, I just need to make covers first. I've really loved writing and I keep having so many ideas.

Thanks again!
