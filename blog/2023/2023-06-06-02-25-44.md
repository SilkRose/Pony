# Darling and Date Story Update 11

Darling and Date chapter 4 is almost 5k words, I'm really close to finishing writing it.  
I think another 500 to 800 words, and it will be done. I'm really excited.  
After it's all written, begins the daunting task of proofreading, I've done a lot as I write, but I still know there is so much to do.

Also, next week I will be releasing another one shot romance story! It's all done, I love the cover!  
And, if everything goes well, the week after that I will be releasing another one shot romance story. Cover has started being made. I'm going to write it this upcoming week.

Then the last full week of July, Darling and Date will be releasing! I'm really excited about this release and I hope I can hit it.

Thanks everypony, I really hope you like all these stories!  
Stay safe!
