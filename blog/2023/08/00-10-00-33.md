# Schedule Update

This week will be the first week in ten weeks that I don't have a story ready. I've decided to release a story every two weeks instead of every week. I want to have more time to learn new writing styles, improve the stories I release, and most importantly, not stress myself out as much.

Thanks for the understanding!
