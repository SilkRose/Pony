# Darling and Date Story Update 4

Chapter 3 is now at 4.2k words, making progress.  
I've been a bit more busy in real life the last few days, I'm hoping to get more writing done soon.  
I'd like to finish chapter 3 this week, and I think I can do it. I'm expecting it to be around 6k words.

Thanks again.
