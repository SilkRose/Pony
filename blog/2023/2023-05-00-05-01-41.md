# Darling and Date Story Update 7

Chapter 3 is done! It's almost 7.2k words long, I really like how this chapter ended.  
Now there is only chapter 4 and an epilogue left to write, I am going to write the epilogue next.  
I'm excited about the epilogue, but can't share the reason because of spoilers.  
I'm expecting the epilogue to be 1.5k to 2.5k words long.

Thanks for the patients.
