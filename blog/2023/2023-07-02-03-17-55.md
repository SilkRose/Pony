# Best of Seventy-One

Bo71 is out! Finished it the day of posting, lol. Eight hours before posting.

Next week's story is already done, and so is the week's after that.

I think the week's after that will be done soon too.

So, writing has been going good. Had so many ideas lately. Making good progress on some.

I've been getting better at making my own covers, going to be doing a lot more.

Thanks, all.
