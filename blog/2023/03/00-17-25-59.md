# Pretty and Pink Sequel Update 4

Chapter 2 of the sequel just passed 2k words, wrote 460 words today alone.  
I'm really happy with the progress I'm making. I have redone the way I'm doing the outline, and it's way better now.  
Before I was detailing too much, and it got too hard to keep track of everything, now I'm only outlining the major plot points for each chapter.

I really think this story will be great and that you will like it if you liked Pretty and Pink!  
Thanks for being patient.
