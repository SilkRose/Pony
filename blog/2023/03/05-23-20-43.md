***

The sequel is coming along nicely, almost done with the first chapter at 4000 words.  
My plan is to have 3 chapters and an epilogue.  
I've stopped using Google Drive for writing and have switched over to using sync thing and Obsidian.md.  
So far, I really like the new environment, and it has let me be far more productive in writing.  
I'm also storing my Obsidian vault in a public repo on GitHub.  
If anyone wants to proofread the sequel, feel free to PM me on here.

Thanks, everypony!
