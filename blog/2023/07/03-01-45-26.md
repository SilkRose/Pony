# Love Licks

Love Licks has been out for a couple of days, it's done great, thank you all!

I've trimmed down the eight WIP stories I am working on from ten to six, to try and not overwhelm myself.

Next week's story has no words down, but I'm going to try to write half of it tonight. I made the cover last week.

As always, thanks again.
