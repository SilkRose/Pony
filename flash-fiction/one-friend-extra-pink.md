# One Friend, Extra Pink

It's about a dystopian future where Equestria has devolved to the point where ponies buy friends to talk to. It will be about Twilight's first time going to one of these places, and she meets Pinkie, and they fall for each other.

The door closes behind me after I enter an establishment I've never been in before. Looking around I see mostly empty tables with the occasional pair of ponies, and couches with more stains than should even be possible. Several ponies sat on the cleaner sections of the couches, all of them making out with each other. Barely functioning lights buzz above me as a greeter pony approaches me.

They skip all formalities and get straight to the point. "What's your name, and would you like a table for talking or a couch for cuddling?"

I answer, "Twilight Sparkle, and can I cuddle at a table?"

"Sure, I don't care."

They start trotting off and I follow. I'm led to a table in a secluded corner, far from other ponies. I sit down, and they leave without saying a word. I sigh as I take in s deep breath. I immediately regret this as a wave of dust filters into my lungs, sending me into a coughing fit.

I eventually recover, just in time for the waitress to appear. They ask, "What kind of pony would you like to see today?"

I nervously say, "One friend, extra pink."

They leave without even acknowledging my answer. I'm left sitting there alone with my thoughts and all the dust in the air.

I take the time and use my magic to try to clean the table me and my new friend are going to use. After all, you want to make a good first impression. I slide all the dust onto the floor before doing the same for the bench seat I'm on. After finishing the other bench seat, my new friend appears.

I introduce myself. "Hi, my name is Twilight Sparkle."

My new friend is a pink earth pony mare, with bubbly hair and an even more bubbly smile. She had a pink mane and tail, beautiful blue eyes, and a cutie mark of balloons. She sat down across from me and introduced herself. "Hi, my name is Pinkie Pie!"

I sheepishly ask, "How's your day going?"

"It's going great, especially now that I get to make a new friend! It's been a while since somepony asked for a pink friend."

I smile at her. "I'm glad I could help."

She smiles back. "Well, how can I help you today, Twilight?"

"I don't know, I've never done this before. How is it supposed to work?"
