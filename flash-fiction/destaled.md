# Destaled

I reside in the box, drawing stale air with a raspy, shallow breath. The box's cardboard bottom providing only a modicum of comfort for my sore side. The blackness surrounds me as my regrets tick through my mind with each beat of my heart.

I should have never eaten those cupcakes. I should have never agreed to play hide and seek with Sweetie Belle. I should have left the lid open. I should have gotten out when I started feeling funny. I should have done a lot of things.

I try to slow my staggered breathing as I feel the oxygen dwindling inside the box. A piece of dust gets caught in my throat, sending me into another involuntary coughing fit. Each cough bringing up an unknown substance from the depths of my stomach.

I would cry if I could; I lost that ability when I became paralyzed. Now, I only cry when my body decides to, and it's not nearly enough to alleviate any of my fears. No, I just have to lay here, afraid of the inevitable.

I'm going to die. I've accepted it, but I still fear it. Nopony ever wants to die, but here I am, forced to endure each breath until the end. Forced to die a slow and painful death as my best friend tries to find me, blissfully unaware of the foregone conclusion I'm trapped in.

I was always afraid of the dark, but that's nothing compared to death. I'd gladly go blind if it meant I could still feel the world with my hooves, hear my friends' voices. I'd make that deal in a heartbeat if there were such a benevolent grim reaper waiting outside this box.

I'm terrified for my friends, as they will be forced to live in a world knowing they're the reason I'm no longer in it. Sweetie Belle will bear the heaviest of the guilt; she was the whole reason I got in this situation. I don't fault her at all, but I know her. She'll blame herself over and over and over, and she doesn't deserve to live like that.

Suddenly, I hear hoofsteps near the box, and hope floods my thoughts. Somepony is close, somepony could save me! They get so close to the box, I can feel the vibration of their hoofsteps through the floor. I can hear them calling my name as I try with all my might to yell, scream, pound, anything to get their attention.

Sweetie Belle trots away as all of my attempts were for naught. Nothing worked, nothing could save me now. The one chance I had for salvation, trotting away, sealing my end. She was so close, and I so helpless.

My body decides to pity me as I start to cry. I enjoy every teardrop as it will most likely be the last shred of comfort I have in life. Each drop rolling down my face as I dream of making the noise. Wishing for one last good cry before I go.
