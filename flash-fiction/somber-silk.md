I look down at the blue unicorn in my hooves and smile.

*Such a cute pony.*

I decide that it's my turn to lay on him, so I lay him down on the bed and rest my head on his chest.

I whisper to his still sleeping form, "I love you."

I close my eyes and nuzzle his chest, listening to his heartbeat.

I whisper again, "You know, I don't know where I'd be without you."

"Probably in debt, unhappy, and lost."

"I'm so glad we met. I can't believe it was over a *unique* writing style."

I chuckle to myself.

"You mean so much to me, you know that?"

I don't get an answer, so I decide to kiss his chest.

"I mean it, but even with you in my life, I still have fears and doubts."

"I'm just hoping there maybe something you can help me work though."

I wait a few minutes as I enjoy holding him, listening to his heart beating.

"I'm afraid that nopony will care about my writing."

"I'm afraid that I will inspire nopony."

"That's the whole reason I write in the open, to give freely my work so that others may make new and beautiful things with it."

"But, what if it's for not?"

"What if nopony does do anything with it? Will I have put all that effort in for nothing?"

"It's hard to know what to do sometimes."

"I guess it's hard to inspire others when nopony knows about where your work is available."

"I know you always say I'll become bigger than you as a writer, but in my opinion, you will always be the better writer."

"I want to become better as a writer, we all do, right?"

"I'd like to turn this into a job somehow, but I don't see that happening for a long time, if ever."

"More than likely, I'll have to get a regular job, which scares me."

"Never had any luck with those."

"But, maybe that's because it wasn't required I had luck at the time, if you know what I mean."

"I like being self-employed, and that's what I'm going to do for as long as I can."

"I'm afraid that when my parents are gone, I won't have anywhere to go, that I'll become homeless and another statistic."

"Who's going to hire somepony with only half a year of employment record in the past ten years."

"I feel like I've tried to help ponies less fortunate than me in my life, I just hope somepony will do the same if I ever end up there."

"I feel like if I had to be homeless, I could survive, but what kind of life is that?"

"Something I think about a lot is, what will happen to the others, the ponies who aren't ready to be adults, who were sheltered their whole life?"

"I'm terrified for them."

"I feel like I'm rambling at this point, what do you think?"

I look up at him.

Getting no answer, I lay my head back down.

I do a play voice, "*You are really cute and pretty, I love you so much!*"

"Aw, thank you so much! I love you too!"

I blush at my own silly game.

"*Mwah, there, I kissed your blush.*"

"You're so sweet."

"*You too, my cute, pretty, wonderful pony!*"

"You mean so much to me. I've really enjoyed all the cuddling."

"*I have too, you are so soft, and I love your mane.*"

"You flatter me." I blush more.

*This is so silly.*

"*You are a silly pony.*"

"You're the silly pony." I boop him in his sleep.

"*You're the one booping sleeping ponies.*"

I giggle. "This conversation took a one-eighty."

"*Every conversation takes a one-eighty to talk about how cute you are.*"

"Okay, I get it. I'm adorable."

"*And pretty.*"

I somehow make myself blush harder.

"I really need to stop talking to myself."

"*But, you're so cute at it!*"

I nuzzle his chest and sign.

"*What's wrong?*"

"I don't know, I just wish this we're real."

"*Just wake him up, and it could be.*"

"You know what I mean."

"*Until you can make it real, this will have to do.*"

"You're right."

"*Can we go back to talking about how pretty you are?*"

"Yes, yes we can."

He wakes up. "So, I picked a good time to wake up because you are very pretty."

My blush intensifies a lot. "How much did you hear?"

"Enough to know that you are the most prettiest mare in the world, and that your voice for me is absolutely adorable."

I bury my head in his chest, hiding my blush.

A few moments later, I say, "I love you."

He pulls my head up and brushes my mane out of my eyes. "I love you too."

He leans down and kisses my blush tenderly.

My blush explodes as I lean in to kiss him.

He reciprocates as tears start to flow from my eyes.

*I love him so much!*

We break the kiss, and he asks, "Why don't you go to bed, you need your sleep if you're going to keep your record for most cuddly pony in all of Equestria."

"Okay, Mr. cute pony that is really handsome and who I love."

"I love you too, Mrs. cute pony that is really pretty and who I think makes the best pillow."

"Okay, I'll sleep, but I'm holding you again."

"You won't hear any complaints from me."

"You're going to hear some from me: You're too cute, why are you so soft, when I do get to be the one who is slept on while the story is happening?"

"You're the cute one, you're the softest pillow, and whenever you write it."

"You're too cute."

"You."

"I love you."

"I love you too."

We swap places, him laying his head on my chest, using me for a pillow.

Hey says, "Your heartbeat is really cute, you know."

My heart rate increases. "Goodnight."

"Goodnight."
