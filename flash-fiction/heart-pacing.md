I stand there at Fluttershy's door, heart pounding in my chest as I realize what I'm about to do.

*I'm going to ask her out.*

I try to calm myself down, taking slow, deliberate breaths.

I knock on the door and wait.

A few agonizing moments pass before Fluttershy answers.

"Hello, Twilight."

"Hi, Fluttershy," I try not to say bashfully.

"What brings you here?"

"I wanted to talk to you about something."

My heart speed back up again as she leads me inside.

"What did you want to talk about?"

I sit down on her couch, and she sits beside me.

I don't say anything as I stare at her, taking in her beauty.

*You can do this, Twilight, just stay calm.*

"Fluttershy, I have a crush on you."

I feel my heart beating out of my chest, bracing for the worst, I close my eyes.

A few moments go by where she doesn't say anything, but as I'm starting to crash, I feel hooves wrap around me.

"Twilight, I love you as a friend, and while I don't have feelings for you. I'm willing to try this out with you because it clearly means so much to you."

"You will go out with me?" I ask in disbelief.

"Yes."

I wrap my hooves around her, holding her tight. "Thank you, Fluttershy."

"Thank you," Fluttershy says before pecking my cheek with a small kiss.

I blush as I nuzzle her gently.

I kiss her cheek as I start to think of all the fun things I want to do with Fluttershy.

*I can't wait to make you smile.*
