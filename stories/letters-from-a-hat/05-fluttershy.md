Dear Rainbow Dash,

  

Hello! I hope this message finds you well. 

Well… I hope it finds you at all. I may have forgotten your mailing address (if you even have one?) And I think it would be weird to go find you just to ask for your mailing address so I can send you a letter instead of just talking to you, so I just wrote the letter and mailed it. The mailpony can probably find you!

I suppose you know why I'm sending this letter, so I'll just say it: I heard about your fight with Applejack. Or, well, *fight* might be putting it strongly. But you two disagreed - like you always do (I don't think that's putting it strongly) - about what to do with the Changeling delegation. I don't mean to lecture you about it. It just seems strange, isn't it, since you are so alike.

You're both very competitive and quick to help others, and neither of you are afraid to speak your mind or assert yourselves. You especially have this intensity in everything you do… I don't understand it? But I appreciate it? Does that make sense? Sorry, I don't think that makes sense.

Anyway, maybe that all felt like a normal day with a normal argument with ponies you love but argue with, but I think Applejack may feel unappreciated. She's really sensitive under that rigid exterior, you know? And I know you're really kind and compassionate under that rough exterior too. So, I think maybe you could talk to her, try to understand her better… and give her a big hug. I know you want to! (I think. You don't have to if you're not comfortable with it. But it's just a hug. You like hugs, don't you?)

That reminds me, actually, of something I don't think I've told anyone. Not even you. But here it goes. You're the first pony that ever hugged me, back when we were in school on Cloudsdale. My village had only just incorporated, remember, and my parents weren't… They weren't the type. To hug anyone, I mean. And I know it wasn't really the whole thing. You'd just won that game (I forget what it was called) for our team, and there was a crowd, and you'd only wrapped one hoof around me while you raised the other in the air and cheered, but I think that was my first one.

Well, maybe that's enough rambling from me…

  

~~Always for~~ Oh! Right! I'm supposed to do some other things. I have some pass-along messages for you.

Pinkie Pie says: "Friendship is like a party, both are fun and lead to smiles."

Applejack says: "It’s always worth it to give your family and friends a little love whenever you see them."

And my pass-along message for you is: "Hug your closest pony." 

There are no ponies close to me, so I'll give extra hugs to Angel (he hates it!), but I'm excited to hear who you hug! (If you're okay with that! Again!)

And I'm also supposed to suggest something we could do together. I could go with the obvious, (hugs!) but instead I'm going to ask: Can we go back to Canterlot together some day? We've been there since I met Twilight and our other friends, but those visits were always hectic and sometimes terrifying. Rarity would know what I mean! But I'd like to just visit with you and walk around the city and see what's changed, and what hasn't. That would be nice, I think.

Okay, that's it! For sure this time!

  

Always for you,
