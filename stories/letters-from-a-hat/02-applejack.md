# Applejack → Pinkie Pie ([Rego](https://www.fimfiction.net/user/180061/Rego))

Dear Pinkie Pie,

It was probably for the best all things considered. To be honest, I’m still a little heated. I know she ain’t all that interested in getting her hooves dirty, but she didn’t have to go as far as she did. There’s a whole world of difference between a rodeo and a Wonderbolt show!

By the way, thanks for the butter. Granny was glad to have it considering we were running low, but maybe pack them separately next time? The letter’s a mite slippery, and Winona’s been trying to sneak a lick whenever I’m not looking. Last thing I want is to tell Twilight the dog ate my homework.

Honestly, I didn’t know most of that—outside of the hug since I just got it—but to tell you the truth, I did know you liked Twilight. It’s really sweet, though I ain’t too sure she’s figured it out yet. Give that girl some time. You both think in your own ways, and I think I can see it working out.

You know, I’ve heard all of that before plenty of times, but reading it in writing? Hits different. I don’t know why neither, but it feels good to be loved by your friends. When you first showed up at Ponyville looking for friends, it was a bit weird at first, but it didn’t take you long at all to find where you fit. Now? You’re one of the spokes that keeps our wagon wheel of a town rolling right along. I don’t even want to think what Ponyville would be like without Pinkie Pie to brighten up the day. I don’t think I can name a single memory as my favorite as I just enjoy our every day. It doesn’t need to be special to be special, if you know what I mean.

And now I gotta write this part with RD and Rarity, don’t I? The whole point of this letter writing stuff Twilight has us doing. I stepped away from the letter to think on it for a bit, but mostly to calm down. You must’ve galloped back home the moment we wrapped up because I’d barely walked in the door before you had this in my hooves.

When it comes right down to it, Rarity and Rainbow know what it’s like to be a big sister, though admittedly Dash is a bit more slapdash about it. When the chips are down, they know how to step up and act to keep their family safe. Family’s a big thing for me, but you already know that. Like you said, we might be more than a few steps removed, but we’re still family.

I’ll be sure to pass your message along to—Whoops! Almost let it slip! I’ll pass it along to them and I guess whoever Rego is… Ain’t that a kind of sauce of something?

Looking forward to the next hug, cousin,  
Applejack
