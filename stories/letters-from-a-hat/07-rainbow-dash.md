Dear Spike,

Hey, how ya doing man?!

Give me some hoof… Er, hand? Claw?

…

Guess that does not work too well over letters.

I have never really been the biggest fan of writing, until recently, that is. I'm really beginning to enjoy the way words become sentences and sentences become meaning and how meaning can change the world!

Er… I mean, it's cool, I guess.

I'm losing track of the point.

That's what it was!

I was very happy to have drawn your name from Twilight's hat. I mean yes, I was just glad to not have to write to rarity after our spat, or Celestia forbid Applejack after what I called her, or even worse what if I drew Celestia or even Luna! What would I say then?! _Hey royal sister, nice mane! Want to hang out? Here's some advice from earlier in the chain?_

I mean it's not like I haven't written to them before… but it feels somewhat different now. 

~~I feel embarrassed~~ I am not proud of how I acted, of how I treated my friends during that argument, it was uncool, and at the moment I am not comfortable talking to the princesses with that on my conscience.

On the other hoof, I was ecstatic to pull your name from the hat, you're such a cool guy!

It's funny that we haven't done much together, I mean, I'm cool, you're cool, cool ponies hang out, that's what they do! And yet, we haven't done anything, just the two of us.

I guess Twilight keeps you pretty busy. Being the direct assistant to a princess must be hard work. I'm sure you really enjoy your naps! But I am losing track of my point again. 

Want to hang out sometime?

Me and Fluttershy were planning on a trip to Canterlot sometime soon, and I'm sure she wouldn't mind the extra company, I'll ask her later today just to be sure.  I bet there's a rad comic book store somewhere in the city that we could check out… and did you hear in Canterlot ponies are putting wheels on boards and doing flips? I've heard of scooters, but what's that about!? Almost sounds like something out of a Daring Do Book!

Losing sight of the topic again, sorry…

There is also some advice I wanted to ask Fluttershy about on the trip, as theoretically, we could find a quiet spot away from everypony else, but it is something I would like your advice on too, as it's something I think you might know something about… but you have to pinky-promise to not tell anypony, any creature else!

~~I think~~

I think I like somepony… don't worry, it's not Rarity. I didn't realize until after the argument, but I wish I had.  ~~I think I love her.~~

I… I don't want to write anymore about it! Burn this letter after you read it!

Anyway, enough about my emotional turmoil. How are you? How's life as Twilight's number one assistant? Any crazy adventures or funny stories? I bet you've got a ton. Like I've said, we don't chat enough… I'd love to hear all about them!

Oh, ya! One more thing!

If I understand right, we are supposed to pass some messages down the chain.

So here it goes!

Pinkie Pie wrote: "Friendship is like a party, both are fun and lead to smiles."

Applejack wrote: "It's always worth it to give your family and friends a little love whenever you see them."

I truly hope me and her are still friends, I don't know what I would do if…

I don't want to think about it.

Fluttershy's pass-along message was : "Hug your closest pony." 

We can never know when our last chance will be.

Regarding my advice, my message for the chain…

I don't really know.

My first thought was to just go with something sappy, like be awesome because if you're not awesome for you, no-pony will be… but that didn't feel right. It doesn't match where my head is at the moment.

Here is my advice, my message to pass along to the next ponies:

Don't be afraid to ask for help, even somepony as cool as me, or as cool as you, cannot be expected to solve every problem on their own.

Your Pal,
Dash
