# Starlight → Celestia ([TheAncientPolitzanian](https://www.fimfiction.net/user/338193/TheAncientPolitzanian))

Dear Princess Celestia,

I hope you won't mind that I instinctively kept up the formalities with that greeting, but after restarting my letter to Spike twice, I'm trying to refrain from censoring my first impulse and Holy ~~Celestia~~ ~~You~~ Moly is writing to you stressful. Horseapples, immediately broke my own rule. Story of my life, huh?

Actually, now that I've brought it up, Twilight told me the other day you apparently had no idea your name was an expression. Personally, it sounded to me like you were just joking about that, but either way, that must feel pretty weird, huh? If it helps, I can think of a few potential applications for "Pulling a Starlight", and let's just say none of them are particularly positive, so hey, your expressions being positive is absolutely a plus! I'm rambling, aren't I? I'd say disregard everything I just wrote, but again, ignoring things is what we're explicitly <span style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span> doing here, so just do with it what you will, I guess.

The funny thing is, before my "reformation" or whatever you want to call it, I used to really, really hope I'd get to talk to you someday. Face-to-face talk, even. Sure, when I first started Our Town, I was terrified you'd swoop in to shut the whole thing down any second, but once I finally felt like I had something really worth showing, I couldn't wait for the day you'd catch wind of what I'd been up to. Sooner or later, I told myself, I'd have the chance to show you what we'd — I'd, really — created, show you it was so much better than the way things were… and then you'd, I don't know, bow down to me on the spot or something. Stupid, stupid, stupid.

Instead, I got your student. That's a funny story too, actually: when I left the rest of Equestria behind, everypony'd only <span style="text-decoration:underline;">just</span> gotten used to Cadance popping out from nowhere. Sure, occasionally I'd get drip-fed a tidbit or two from a new arrival to the village, but it really didn't prepare me for everything that changed in my absence. It probably took everything in me to keep from going to pieces when I saw those wings on Twilight's back, and I'm <span style="text-decoration:underline;">still</span> getting culture shocks like that every now and again. (If I make Applejack re-explain the rules to this hot new "buckball" sports thing again, I'm pretty sure she'll buck <span style="text-decoration:underline;">me</span> into next week.) There I was, trying to change the world, all the while knowing less and less of what it even was. Not particularly leader-y of me, is that?

Which I guess is as good a lead-in as any to the "suggestion" section: would it be any trouble if we talked over tea at some point or another? Then again, now that I'm writing this, I'm realizing Trixie's limited grasp on transmogrification has spoiled my taste for tea at the moment; would hot cocoa work? I know it's not the most regal or whatever, but… Point is, you — and the other princesses, I suppose — have been content to leave my reorientation in Twilight and her friends' hooves, and I'm incredibly grateful for everything she's taught me, but I'd appreciate hearing your insight into where I've been and where I'm heading. I get the sense there's <span style="text-decoration:underline;">something</span> I could stand to learn from you, and I may as well learn it now before another bug queen abducts everypony or the Cutie Map sends me off to… well, to not-even-you-know-where! Ha.

Alright, I've said everything that's come to mind — at least, everything I wasn't already planning on sticking in the postscript — so here's the chain of messages from everypony I'm meant to pass along:

Pinkie: "Friendship is like a party, both are fun and lead to smiles."

Applejack: "It's always worth it to give your family and friends a little love whenever you see them."

Fluttershy: "Hug your closest pony."

Rainbow Dash: "Don't be afraid to ask for help; even somepony as cool as me, or as cool as you, cannot be expected to solve every problem on their own." ~~<sub>(Huh, that's a lot longer than I'd have expected from her. Chalk that up to the whole "stream of consciousness" thing, I guess.)</sub>~~

Spike: "Words are strong."

And that just leaves me to come up with mine, doesn't it? Looking back it that list, it's hit me all over again just how lucky I am that each of those ponies (and the dragon, of course!) have accepted me into their lives, even in spite of the myriad of reasons not to. So, considering both that and what I've already written above, I think I'll offer forth <span style="text-decoration:underline;">"There's a world outside your head. Don't be afraid to let it in."</span> ~~Not sure if it's all that good or relevant~~ On second thought, slathering my every other thought in self-doubt is gratuitous. In any case, I'm really eager to hear your response! (At least, I'm trying to; right now it's just equal parts "eager" and "nervous". Isn't there a Pinkie-ism for that, now that I think of it? Eh, I digress.)

Sincerely,  
Starlight Glimmer

P.S. Just wanted to leave this here at the bottom: Thanks for helping Twilight get so many of Our Town's permits through — I can't imagine dragging all of that through the system retroactively was all that pleasant. I have decidedly mixed feelings about the fact that so many of my ex-followers think it's worth staying there, but I guess I'm glad they got something of value from my exercise in megalomania. I really do appreciate you doing that for them.
