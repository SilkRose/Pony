# Letters from a Hat



Twilight suggested, "Why don't we do a friendship building exercise, doesn't that sound fun?"

Rarity nodded.

Rainbow Dash shrugged.

Applejack shook her head.

"It'll be fun, I promise!" Twilight said before taking Applejack's hat in her magic.

Twilight gave them each a slip of paper and a pencil. "Write your name down and put it in the hat. Trust me, this game will be fun."

Before anypony could put their paper in the hat, Pinkie popped out of said hat, and startled Twilight.

"Ah," Twilight shouted, not expecting Pinkie's presence.

Pinkie was unfazed by Twilight's reaction. "Hi Twilight, Applejack, Rarity, and Rainbow! Did somepony say game? I love games."

Twilight recovered, and explained, "Yes, we are doing a friendship exercise, and I was just about to explain how it works."

She gave Pinkie a piece of paper and a pencil. "We are going to draw names from the hat and write them a letter, then we will also write a reply letter to the pony who sent you a letter."

Pinkie raised her hoof almost immediately.

"Yes Pinkie?" Twilight asked.

"Can I add a few more ponies to the hat? Don't want to exclude anypony from this fun activity."

"Sounds like a good idea, sure."

"Yay!"

Pinkie put her slip of paper in before writing a few more and adding them.

Twilight looked at the group of ponies assembled around her. "These are not required, but some good ideas for you to include in your letters are: reveal something about yourself, ask them a question, preferably about friendship, and give them a compliment."

Twilight received various nods and agreements of understanding.

She asked, "Okay, who wants to go first?"

Pinkie spoke up immediately, "Oh! Me! Me!"
