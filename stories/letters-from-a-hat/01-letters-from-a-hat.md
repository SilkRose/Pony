# Letters from a Hat

Rainbow Dash, Rarity, and Applejack were in Rarity's kitchen discussing the very common topic of changeling clothing.

"They should wear racing stripes, that'd make them look cooler," Rainbow Dash said enthusiastically.

"What an absolutely preposterous idea. What would a racing stripe clothing article even look like? Why would a changeling want to wear that?" Rarity commented.

"That is the dumbest clothing idea I've ever heard, at least Rarity's idea would look good," Applejack said flatly.

"Like your idea is any better, they don't need protective clothing if they can just change into something with actual armor," Rainbow retorted.

"They don't need racing stripes, and they don't need armor, they need to look good," Rarity brought up.

"At least my idea is practical, who cares if they look nice or go faster, or whatever," Applejack said.

"I care," Rainbow and Rarity said in unison.

"Well, I don't," Applejack said harshly.

"I don't care about your idea, it's not as practical as you think it is," Rainbow said.

"Her idea makes sense, unlike racing stripes," Rarity chided.

Twilight trotted into the kitchen. "What's going on in here?"

Applejack answered, "Rainbow Dash is trying to put racing stripes on changelings and Rarity is trying to make them look pretty."

"Applejack is trying to give them armor when they can just change into something with armor," Rainbow added.

"My idea is objectively the best, a changeling who looks nice will feel the nicest," Rarity said.

The three ponies' argument only intensified when they started name-calling, clearly taking this way too seriously.

Twilight just sighed as she stared at three of the ponies that will be with her for the rest of her life.

Twilight just watched them bicker back and forth as she collected herself. A few moments later, she shouted, "Stop!"

After everypony stopped their arguing, Twilight suggested, "Why don't we do a friendship building exercise, doesn't that sound fun?"

Rarity nodded.

Rainbow Dash shrugged.

Applejack shook her head.

"It'll be fun, I promise!" Twilight said before taking Applejack's hat in her magic.

Twilight gave them each a slip of paper and a pencil. "Write your name down and put it in the hat. Trust me, this game will be fun."

Before anypony could put their paper in the hat, Pinkie popped out of said hat, and startled Twilight.

"Ah," Twilight shouted, not expecting Pinkie's presence.

Pinkie was unfazed by Twilight's reaction. "Hi Twilight, Applejack, Rarity, and Rainbow! Did somepony say game? I love games."

Twilight recovered, and explained, "Yes, we are doing a friendship exercise, and I was just about to explain how it works."

She gave Pinkie a piece of paper and a pencil. "We are going to draw names from the hat and write them a letter, then we will also write a reply letter to the pony who sent you a letter."

Pinkie raised her hoof almost immediately.

"Yes Pinkie?" Twilight asked.

"Can I add a few more ponies to the hat? Don't want to exclude anypony from this fun activity."

"Sounds like a good idea, sure."

"Yay!"

Pinkie put her slip of paper in before writing a few more and adding them.

Twilight looked at the group of ponies assembled around her. "These are not required, but some good ideas for you to include in your letters are: reveal something about yourself, ask them a question, preferably about friendship, and give them a compliment."

Twilight received various nods and agreements of understanding.

She asked, "Okay, who wants to go first?"

Pinkie spoke up immediately, "Oh! Me! Me!"
