Dear Applejack,

  

Wow, that's a lot!

… Sorry. That may not have been the best way to start this. It's just that I can't remember the last time I got a letter from you, or any of the girls really, and then… all this! Wow!

… Sorry again.

I don't think you have to apologize for saying anything to Rainbow Dash just because she's my friend. She's your friend, too, of course! And arguments with her can get pretty intense, but that's the way she likes it. Ponies should get more comfortable with disagreeing with her. At least that's how I feel when I'm with her. (Don't tell her I said that.?)

If I'm supposed to be really honest in these letters, then… I'm sorry, I didn't know the rodeo was so important to you. ~~I don't know if I knew anything was important to you.~~ Oh, Celestia, there's another terrible thing I just wrote without thinking about how it would read when it was on paper… Am I allowed to erase things? It looks like you crossed some things out. I'm going to cross that out. Anyway, you always seem so dedicated to everything you do, I kind of thought you wanted to do everything, liked doing everything… Not equally. That's a foalish way of thinking about it, right? ~~But it just didn't occur that you had special priorities. Not special relative to other ponies, but special in the sense that~~ Oh this is such a mess already. I promise you're not asking too much. I'm just not good with… words. Sorry.

Taking my hoof out of my mouth. How about this: I'll go to the next rodeo with you. I don't really know what goes on at a rodeo, but if they're as dirty as Rarity says, then I'll sit in the front row and get dirty! Just as long as I don't have to compete, ha ha ha. (Would they let a pegasus compete? Would they make one compete? Please don't let them make me compete.)

It might overlap with this year's bunny census, but honestly, I was hoping for an excuse not to get involved this year. The first few times were fun when it was just a local survey, but they've been getting way too serious about all this bureaucracy, especially after the Whitetail plenary session. Take me away, please!

  

Always for you,

P.S. I love your message. You can hug me as often and as long as you need, Applejack.
