# Pinkie Pie â†’ Applejack

Dear Applejack,

I thought of a fun game we can all play! We're playing it right now. All you have to do is pick a cutie mark from the hat and write them a letter after writing a letter to me. Sounds fun, right? Oh, you know what else can be fun, learning about your friends! I'm going to tell you stuff about me that you probably didn't know!

Yesterday I had grass soup for dinner. Tomorrow, when I give you this letter, I'm going to give you a hug too! I was born on a Tuesday. My middle name is Diane. And I have a crush on Twilight.

This letter is supposed to make us closer friends, so have some compliments! Applejack, you are such an amazing friend! I couldn't imagine not having you in my life. You are so reliable and dependable, and there is nothing you can't do. Your honesty is super amazing, and your knowledge of farming is super useful.

I've got so many questions I wanna ask you, but I'll stick to just a few. What's your favorite thing about each of our friends, Rarity and Rainbow? What's one of your favorite memories with me?

I'll answer them too! Rarity can always see the good in a situation, I know she can be dramatic, but after she calms down, she can still wear a smile. Rainbow Dash is so loving, despite the whole cool pony act, I know deep down how much she cares and loves her friends. I think one of my favorite memories with you is when we went to go see Goldie Delicious to see if I'm a part of the apple family. I'm still so happy that you guys see me as family!

Let's have some fun with this! Please pass this message along: `Friendship is like a party, both are super fun and lead to smiles.`

Your friend,
Pinkie Pie.

P.S. Tell Rego I said hi!
