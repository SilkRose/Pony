Dear Fluttershy,

~~Daring Do fluttered through the forest of tall dark trees, sweat poured at her~~ 

Sorry for the state of the paper, I had to improvise with some scraps I had on- 

~~brow and soaked her to the bone.~~

Wing.

~~She looked left, then right, unsure of from where the danger might come.~~

I left the letter I wanted to give you at home. I wanted to give you a written response because ~~I didn't want to mess up~~ because somepony as cool as you deserve words she can keep!

The mail pony did find me… Eventually, although how somepony can set a cloud on fire is beyond me.

Er… I'm sorry, I didn't mean to worry you, everything turned out alright in the end, and I got your letter! Thank you for your kind words.

I don't know if I would dare hug Applejack right now. I feel like that would lead to a sore jaw and a week underground. I would definitely like to, though, in the future, when things have cooled down. I… I feel bad, I shouldn't have pushed her so far. She said some horrible things about the Wonder Bolts but, but I attacked her personally in return, and that doesn't sit right with me. It's not how a friend should treat a friend, and I was wrong. I hope someday I can apologize to her, and I hope to hug her sometime soon.

I'm getting off track.

What I wanted to write to you was this!

You are awesome ~~200 an~~ Two hundred and ~~ten per~~ twenty percent!

I know things aren't always the smoothest with your family, but you will always have a friend in me. If you ever need anything at all, I have your back, even if all you need is a hug.

Speaking of which, I would love to go to Canterlot with you, name the date and I will be there!  Maybe while we are there, we can find somewhere quiet to talk. There has been ~~somepony~~ something on my mind lately, and I don't think I can keep it to myself much longer. 

Your pal always,
R-Dash

PS. I've been getting into writing fan-fiction recently… but ~~I'm afraid~~ I'm~~worried~~ I can't bring myself to show it to Twilight, or A. K… maybe you could look it over? I know you're not the biggest Daring Due fan, but I would value your opinion.
