- They also send a reply to the pony who sent them a letter.

### Prompt:
Pinkie Pie has started a chain reaction, sending out a letter and a hat full of cutie mark drawings to Applejack. Who, upon reading the letter, kept the chain going by writing a reply to Pinkie and a letter to the name she pulled from this hat. As the chain continues, the past order is known, and their letters can be read, but not quoted, and should not be gleamed for private information. Pinkie's intention is to build connections and friendships among a group of semi-connected friends. The last pony in the chain is to write to Pinkie, who will write a reply back.

Some suggestions to include in your letter(s):
1. A compliment of the recipient.
2. Something they might not know about you.
3. A message to a pony you know hasn't been within the chain.
4. A suggestion for something you two could do together.
