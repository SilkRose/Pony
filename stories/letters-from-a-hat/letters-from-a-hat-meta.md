### Prompt:
Twilight Sparkle found Rarity, Rainbow Dash, and Applejack arguing over how best to represent Equestria to the changelings in an upcoming peace treaty visit. Rarity wanted to do a fashion show, Rainbow a Wonderbolt's show, and Applejack wanted to do a rodeo.

After the argument escalated to name-calling, Twilight broke it up and suggested they do a friendship exercise. Pinkie Pie showed up quickly after a game was mentioned and joined in as well.

Twilight explained the exercise. It was a chain of letters designed to strengthen friendships and give everypony a chance to cool off. The first pony (Pinkie Pie) will send a letter to the pony whose name she pulled from a hat, and that pony would reply, then write a letter to the pony they got from the hat. Rinse and repeat, until the last pony, who writes to Pinkie Pie. Then she writes them a reply.

Some suggestions from Twilight to include in your letter(s):
1. A compliment of the recipient.
2. Something they might not know about you.
3. A message to a pony you know hasn't been within the chain.
4. A suggestion for something you two could do together.
