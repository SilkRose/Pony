# Applejack → Fluttershy ([Rego](https://www.fimfiction.net/user/180061/Rego))

Hey Fluttershy,

I want to start off by apologizing. It took me a couple days to get to this letter. I was still cooling off after that tussle, and I wanted to write to you in a fresher state of mind. I know you and Rainbow go way back before y'all came around to Ponyville, and I didn't want to slip up and say something to upset you. Last thing I want somepony as sweet as you is fretting over something that ain't your problem.

I know the rodeo is more of my thing. Despite its roots, Ponyville ain't all that situated to host a big one. Too many hills and woodlands around here. Only real place to set it up would be pretty out of the way towards the plains if a bunch of the changelings are gonna show up. Meanwhile, Wonderbolt shows happen in the sky and all the artsy stuff could go in the castle and town center. I get all that. But I still want to do a rodeo. 

And that's what made me so mad. Rarity said it'd be doubling up on "athleticism" and too "dirty" as if to say our new friends wouldn't like it. It ain't "putting our best hoof forward" or whatever. I know she said that when things were in the middle of yelling at each other, and I said my piece at the end of my fuse, but I guess it's just, I felt disrespected. I still do.

Look, I know how it sounds, but please just hear me out, okay? Remember how I went to that rodeo in Canterlot a few years back? I know I've been to ones more recent, but that's the one most of the girls recall since I went to Cherry Jubilee's to try to wrangle up some bits to fix up Town Hall. Y'all would've likely chased me all over Equestria to bring me back home, but something that's always lingered in the back of my mind is "Why don't y'all ever go with me?"

Outside of family, only the Crusaders have ever come with me to one, and that was mostly them seeing about earning their cutie marks. I get that everypony has their own life. I can't always help with your bunny census or every Wonderbolt show. Probably wouldn't want me going to a fashion shindig, all things considered. But, why is it that none of y'all have ever come? I work myself to the bone when it ain't harvest season with steeplechasing and barrel dodging. I really enjoy doing it. It's one of the few things I can think of that's earth ponies doing their best.

And before you say, "what about apples?" Twi said she wanted to show the changelings Equestrian culture. Earth ponies ain't just about growing food. Since we became friends, I've sent along more than a few wagons their way brimming with different apples now that they're eating our food instead of our love. They know our staples already. ~~That's what I was trying to say, but I was jus~~ I was hurt, Fluttershy.

I'll admit it. It hurts, honest. Hurts more than herding an ornery family of porcupines with your bare hooves. Y'all always send me off with love and support to my rodeos, but I don't know if y'all actually care when it comes down to it. They ain't as frou-frou as a fashion show. They ain't as flashy as a Wonderbolt derby. But that don't mean rodeos are lesser than those, right? It don't mean that, right? Because I don't know, Fluttershy.

It ain't fair to put you on the spot like this, Fluttershy. You didn't need me unloading all this on you at once. I'm sorry about that. Guess I should count my lucky stars that I didn't get Rainbow or Rarity. I wouldn't have been able to get this off my withers. If it's too much, just send me a note with those things Twi said we should do and I'll let her know I got the letter already.

Speaking of, this list she gave all of us says I should suggest a thing we could do together. I know it's a bit of an ask since we're all so busy these days, but since this exhibition rodeo for the changelings probably ain't happening, could you come to the next rodeo and cheer me on? It'd mean a lot to me. More than you know. Well I guess I could, or rather should since it's on this list here too. Oh boy.

Something you probably don't know about me, since it's something I don't like talking about, is my daddy did the rodeo too. Big Mac's a bit too shy to put on a show, so it was always going to be a two-pony, daddy-daughter trip before ~~he di—~~well, you know. I know this probably sounds like I'm trying to twist you into it, but please. It'd really mean so much to know at least one of my best friends cares about something so dear to me. But please, don't just agree to do it out of the kindness of your heart. If you're really not interested in rodeos, I understand. I'd rather you be honest with me.

~~Sincerely~~  
~~I'm looking forward to~~  
~~Your dear frien~~  
~~Sorry for unloa~~  
Your friend,  
Applejack

P.S. I forgot that chain message deal trying to end this before I'd have to get another page. Pinkie wanted me to pass along the message that "Friendship is like a party, both are fun and lead to smiles." I sure hope I start smiling again soon, sugarcube.

My pass-along message is this: "It's always worth it to give your family and friends a little love whenever you see them."

Something I learned the hard way is that even though you can give somepony a hug anytime you want, there's still a limited number that you'll ever share. I'd give anything in the world to give my momma or daddy just one more.
