Dear Rainbow Dash,

Hey Rainbow Dash. Sorry for the delay. I just… didn't know what to write. I mean, that's a lot of stuff you told me, and I don't know what if I say the wrong thing and ruin everything. I'm sorry, I really hope this is useful.

There was this time when I was little. I broke a dish. It was a white ceramic plate with little blue flowers. I was petrified, like, what if Twilight saw and got upset, and what if she thought I was useless, and what if she left me?

I dropped my chores on the spot and ran out into Canterlot alone, searching for an exact replica of that plate. I was out there for hours until I found a big house retail store which happened to have that exact plate on display. But, I didn't bring bits with me. So I stole it. The pony at the front desk saw me running out and stopped me and asked me who my parents were. I broke down and cried, because I didn't know. Eventually, the guard came in and figured out Twilight was my guardian. So he escorted me back to our home, like a criminal. 

When he knocked on the door, I couldn't look up. My heart froze when I heard it creak open. The guard explained to her that I was found alone with a plate. A thief. She told him she'd look after me better next time, and then she took my claw and brought me inside. My eyes were glued to the floor the whole time, the only picture in my head was the look of utter disappointment on her face. So she sat me down next to her on her couch, and asked me what happened. I told her everything. I expected she'd throw me out of the house immediately, I expected she would hate me, I failed to do my chores, I broke her dish, I went out and tried to steal.

Instead, she hugged me. 

Yes, she was upset that I tried to steal, but do you know what she was more upset with? That I didn't talk to her. Instead of just talking to her, I did twenty backflips and a robbery to hide a mistake I made. She blamed herself more than anything. She said she wished she were around more for me. I still don't understand how it was her fault. In the end, she forgave me because in the end, ponies who care for each other don't break those relationships over silly things.

Don't do twenty backflips RD. You just need to talk to Applejack. A good, honest talk. All ponies make mistakes, even ones as awesome as you. It's scary, but hiding that in your heart. It will consume you.

Oh, and the trip to Canterlot. I'd love to come! 

Your Friend,
Spike
