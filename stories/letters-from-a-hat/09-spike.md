Dear Starlight,

Hey Starlight, how has it been going?

I’m not used to writing letters, besides ones to Celestia, so I'm just going to wing it. There is something I have to get off my chest. I used to not like you. Like, not, not like you. Not any more I promise, but like, when you first came here, and started taking up Twilight's attention I was. Well. I thought you were my replacement. 

I thought that she might’ve been tired of me, and was looking for somepony better. I thought I learned this lesson with the whole Owlowiscious thing, but, I didn’t. I just found it so hard to trust you, after everything. You grew on me, with time, and now every time I look at you, I can’t help but feel guilty at my own previous thoughts, every time, there is a little sting. I just wanted to apologize Starlight, even if you didn’t even know I wronged you. I never got around to apologizing, but this is a good push to doing so. Twilight used to say sometimes along those lines. Ponies need a good push to get something done.

I hope you’re not mad. So, uh, besides that, I heard you saw your parents recently with Sunburst, how was that? What were they like? Just curious, let me know how that went. Twilight said that there is a chain thing we have to do, so let me add my quote down the chain. 

Pinkie Pie wrote: "Friendship is like a party, both are fun and lead to smiles."

Applejack wrote: "It's always worth it to give your family and friends a little love whenever you see them."

Fluttershy's pass-along message was: "Hug your closest pony."

I don’t know what to write, but umm, “Words are strong.” It's used a lot, I know. But, there's a reason for that. Sorry, this letter sucks, I’m used to writing letters for Twilight, not actually writing letters. I’m not really meant to be a writer. I don’t really know what I’m meant to be. Twilight’s assistant? Sorry, sorry, you don’t need to hear that.  

I hope you’re having a good day. Have a good day.

Your friend,  
Spike
