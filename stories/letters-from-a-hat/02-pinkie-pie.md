# Pinkie Pie → Applejack

Dear Applejack,

I know I wasn't a part of the argument that got this thing started, but I am glad I could join in on the fun! Oh, you know what else can be fun, secrets. I actually have a secret I'm going to reveal to you. Twilight did say we should say something about ourselves. And guess what? It's about Twilight!

I have a crush on Twilight, isn't that so exciting? Hey, since I'm going first, you know what that means? I can send a message to Twilight! Can you pass a message along to Twilight for me, pretty please? Tell her that I said she is extra super pretty! I wonder what she will say back!

This letter is supposed to make us closer friends, so have some butter. Applejack, you are such an amazing friend! I couldn't imagine not having you in my life. You are so reliable and dependable, and there is nothing you can't do. Your honesty is super amazing, and your knowledge of farming is super useful.

I've got so many questions I wanna ask you, but I'll stick to just four. What's your favorite thing about each of our friends, Rarity and Rainbow? What's your favorite memory with me? And… uh… do you think Twilight likes me back?

I'll answer them too! Rarity can always see the good in a situation, I know she can be dramatic, but after she calms down, she can still wear a smile. Rainbow Dash is so loving, despite the whole cool pony act, I know deep down how much she cares and loves her friends. And, I really hope Twilight likes me back.

Your friend,
Pinkie Pie.

P.S. Tell Rego I said hi!
