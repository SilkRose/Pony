# Pinkie Pie â†’ Applejack

Dear Applejack,

I know I wasn't a part of the argument that got this thing started, but I am glad I could join in on the fun! Oh, you know what else can be fun, learning about your friends! I'm going to tell you stuff about me that you probably didn't know!



This letter is supposed to make us closer friends, so have some butter. Applejack, you are such an amazing friend! I couldn't imagine not having you in my life. You are so reliable and dependable, and there is nothing you can't do. Your honesty is super amazing, and your knowledge of farming is super useful.

I've got so many questions I wanna ask you, but I'll stick to just a few. What's your favorite thing about each of our friends, Rarity and Rainbow? What's one of your favorite memories with me?

I'll answer them too! Rarity can always see the good in a situation, I know she can be dramatic, but after she calms down, she can still wear a smile. Rainbow Dash is so loving, despite the whole cool pony act, I know deep down how much she cares and loves her friends. I think my one of my favorite memories with you is when we went to go see Goldie Delicious to see if I'm a part of the apple family. I'm still so happy that you guys see me as family!

Your friend,
Pinkie Pie.

P.S. Tell Rego I said hi!
