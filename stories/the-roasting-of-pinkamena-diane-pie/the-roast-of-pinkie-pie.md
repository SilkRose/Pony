# The Roast of Pinkie Pie

After the last attendant sat down in their seat at the local comedy club, Twilight Sparkle got up and walked onto the stage.

Twilight greeted everypony. "Thank you everypony for coming to the roast of Pinkie Pie. We're very excited to celebrate our favorite party pony."

She continued after a round of applause. "I'll go first and call the next pony when I'm done, but before I go, I want to say something to Pinkie."

Twilight looks at Pinkie, who is sitting in the audience. "Pinkie, Thank you for being such a great friend. Thank you for all the laughs you've given us, and thank you for all the parties over the years."

Pinkie smiled back. "You're welcome!"

Twilight starts the roast. "If Pinkie stopped eating cake, I think the price of sugar would drop fifty percent overnight."

Everypony laughs, especially the Cakes.

"Pinkie has either never drank coffee in her life, or drinks twelve cups a day, and I'm not sure which is more concerning."

As the audience laughs around her, Pinkie spits out the coffee she was sipping for this reaction.

"I don't think I've ever seen Pinkie sit still for more than five seconds. The first time I saw her asleep, I had to check for a pulse."

Pinkie sits still as everypony looks at her after laughing, seeing how long she would sit still. She lasted four seconds before laughing.

"Pinkie isn't the only pony getting the attention tonight, though. Rainbow Dash, if your ego were any bigger, it'd have its own gravitational field."

They all looked at Rainbow and noticed the several objects and Pinkie who were floating around Rainbow in a circle. Everypony laughed as Twilight put Pinkie and the objects back.

"The Cakes are up next."

The Cakes got up and took Twilight's place on stage.

Mrs. Cake went first. "Pinkie, we love you, we just wish you would stop giving all our ice cream to Rarity."

Everypony laughed and turned to look at Rarity, who blushed in response, and pushed a tub of ice cream under the table.

Mr. Cake said the next. "Pinkie is a good employee, when she isn't eating our entire inventory in one sitting."

Pinkie blushed as the audience laughed around her.

Mrs. Cake said. "We've had Pinkie living with us since she moved to Ponyville, anyone else want to take a turn?"

Everypony looked around, and when nopony offered to take her, everypony burst into laughter.

Mr. Cake said, "Rarity, you're next."

Rarity got up on stage as the Cakes sat back down.

Rarity said, "You ever slept in the same bed as Pinkie, I have. She started moving around a bunch, here I thought she was trying to cuddle. Turns out it was a Pinkie Sense and a book fell on my head."

Pinkie speaks up, "What book was it?"

Rarity blushes. "It was *How to Cuddle the Pink Pony in your Bed.* It was a rather specific book."

As the crowd giggled and awed, Rarity blew Pinkie a kiss. Wo caught it and blushed.

"After making the dresses for the Gala, I'm surprised I haven't had to do any repairs. I would've thought Pinkie would try to eat the fake candy stitched into her dress at least twice by now."

Pinkie replied, "Don't tempt me, they look tasty," before joining everypony else in laughing.

"I heard that her mane and tail taste like cotton candy, while I have never been brazen enough to try, it at least explains where Gummy gets his nutrition. I don't think I've ever seen her feed him."

Everypony laughed.

"Pinkie, darling, if your mane were any more unkempt, a bird would start building a nest in it. Oh wait, I think I see one now. Fluttershy, what is it saying?"

Everypony turned to Pinkie as a small bird flew out of her mane. Everypony burst into laughter as the bird flew to Fluttershy and landed on her hoof.

Rarity said, "Cutie Mark Crusaders, you're next."

The Cutie Mark Crusaders got on stage, from left to right it went: Scootaloo, Applebloom, Sweetie Belle.

Scootaloo said, "Pinkie is so bad at Pin the tail on the Pony, I saw her pin it to herself."

Everypony looked at Pinkie, who had a prop pony tail pinned to herself, before laughing.

Applebloom said, "You're so pink, I couldn't find you in a pig pen."

Pinkie replied, "Oink, oink," before everypony laughed.

Sweetie Belle said, "You'd make a great alarm clock if you had an off button."

As everypony laughed around her, Pinkie imitated an alarm clock, making the annoying noise four times.

Scootaloo said, "Rainbow Dash naps so much, she'd miss her own funeral."

Everypony looked at Rainbow as she pretended to wake up from a nap. "What'sâ€¦ who's there?"

The audience and Cutie Mark Crusaders all laughed.

Applebloom said, "Applejack's so stubborn, she'd win an argument against a brick wall."

Applejack angrily waived her hoof at the brick wall next to her as laughter erupted.
