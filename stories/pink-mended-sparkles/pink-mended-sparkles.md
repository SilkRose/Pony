# Pink-Mended Sparkles

I turn away from the blinding light, staring at Pinkie.

"Twilight," Pinkie yells.

I hit the floor, hard.

I see Pinkie jump to me, kneeling to hold me.

Her cries get farther and farther as I stare at her.

I try to speak, but nothing comes out as my vision goes black.

The last thing I remember is, *Pinkie.*

***

I wake up, hearing the sound of a sterile heart rate monitor.

I try to open my eyes, and can't. I turn my head left and right.

*Why can't I see?*

"Twilight, you're awake!" Pinkie says.

*Pinkie?*

"Pinkie… what happened?"

"You passed out on the floor, I carried you here as fast as I could."

"I'm… in a hospital, right?"

*Hopefully.*

"Yes."

"Why can't I see?"

"The doctors said the spell temporally blinded you."

"How long in temporary?"

"They said it could be anywhere from days to weeks."

*Oh, great.*

As I lay there, I realize Pinkie has been hugging me this entire time.

I return the hug. "Thank you."

Pinkie hugs me tighter. "You're welcome."

"How long have I been out?"

"A few hours."

"Did they say whether I'm staying here or if I can go home?"

"They said you can go home if somepony is there to help you. I volunteered."

"You didn't have to do that."

"I wanted to… this is my fault after all." Pinkie stops hugging me.

*Don't leave.*

I feel colder without her embrace. "It was my fault… I should have been more prepared."

Pinkie doesn't respond.

"Pinkie?"

"Yes?"

"Can you hold my hoof?"

***

Pinkie leads me into my home, closing the door behind us. She takes me to the couch and I sit down.

Pinkie asks, "What do you wanna do?"

My stomach grumbles, giving me the answer. "Eat."

"Gotcha, what do you want?"

"Anything, I'm starving."

"Okie dokie lokie, just sit tight and Pinkie will make you something delicious."

I hear Pinkie walk away to the kitchen as I am left alone with my thoughts.

*I'm glad Pinkie didn't get blinded too.*

*She doesn't deserve that.*

*Well, at least this condition is temporary, and I have a good friend to help me through it.*

*I'm going to have a lot of time to think.*

*And no time to read!*

*No reading…*

*Maybe Pinkie will read to me?*

*She probably would, but I don't think she'd like reading my usual books.*

*We could read fiction?*

*I'll let her pick the book, she'll have to read it aloud after all.*

I get distracted by a smell from the kitchen, I can't quite tell what it is.

*I should walk to the kitchen, I am going to need to eat in there anyway.*

*Plus, this could be a good test to see how I handle walking by myself.*

*Yes, good idea, Twilight.*

I stand up with confidence.

*Ha, you got this.*

Then I immediately trip on my first step, face-planting to the floor.

*Ow.*

I get back up, bruised ego and all.

*Let's try that again.*

I slowly walk, feeling my way with my hooves, trying to remember the layout of my tree house.

I bump into a lamp.

_Oh, I know this lamp. I bought this last winter and put it on the bookshelf near my writing desk. That should mean the kitchen is to my right._

I turn right and carefully walk forward, trailing my hoof on the wall to keep myself straight.

_Okay, if I remember right, the wall should end right about… here._

Just as predicted, my hoof no longer feels the wall. I reach back so my hoof hits the wall corner and slowly turn right until my hooves feel the floor change to the familiar kitchen tile.

_Now to find the table._

I shuffle my way deeper into the kitchen.

*The table should be to my left.*

I walk forward a little more and turn left. Walking forward, I crash into something.

I panic and grab onto it, falling on top of it.

"Ah," I say in unison with the object I hit.

I take a moment to settle down, releasing my death grip on whatever I landed on.

*I don't like being blind.*

"Pinkie?" I call out as I lay my head on the object under me.

*This is really soft, what's it doing in the kitchen?*

"Twilight, are you okay?" my pillow asks.

*Pinkie!*

"I'm so sorry, Pinkie…"

"It's okay, let's get you up and to the table, come on," Pinkie says before helping me to the table.

"Thank you."

"You gotta be careful, Twilight."

"I will."

Pinkie goes back to making food, as I can hear her making noise at the stove.

"What do you wanna do after we eat?"

"I was thinking maybe you could read me a book?"

"Oh, that sounds fun, what book?"

"I was thinking you could pick, since you are the one reading it."

"I'll be sure to pick something fun!"

"I can't wait," I say as a smile forms on my lips, the first one since becoming temporarily blind.

"Do you want to lay down in bed for it? It can be your bedtime story!"

I yawn and get my answer. "Sure."

*Sounds cozy.*

"Yay!"

"What are you making?"

"Pancakes."

"Sounds delicious."

"Yep!"

I sit quietly and think about my situation.
