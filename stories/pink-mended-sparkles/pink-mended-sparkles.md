# Pink-Mended Sparkles

I turn away from the blinding light, staring at Pinkie.

"Twilight," Pinkie yells.

I hit the floor, hard.

I see Pinkie jump to me, kneeling to hold me.

Her cries get farther and farther as I stare at her.

I try to speak, but nothing comes out as my vision goes black.

The last thing I remember is, *Pinkie.*

***

I wake up, hearing the sound of a sterile heart rate monitor.

I try to open my eyes, and can't. I turn my head left and right.

*Why can't I see?*

"Twilight, you're awake!" Pinkie says.

*Pinkie?*

"Pinkie… what happened?"

"You passed out on the floor, I carried you here as fast as I could."

"I'm… in a hospital, right?"

*Hopefully.*

"Yes."

"Why can't I see?"

"The doctors said the spell temporally blinded you."

"How long in temporary?"

"They said it could be anywhere from days to weeks."

*Oh, great.*

As I lay there, I realize Pinkie has been hugging me this entire time.

I return the hug. "Thank you."

Pinkie hugs me tighter. "You're welcome."

"How long have I been out?"

"A few hours."

"Did they say whether I'm staying here or if I can go home?"

"They said you can go home if somepony is there to help you. I volunteered."

"You didn't have to do that."

"I wanted to… this is my fault after all." Pinkie stops hugging me.

*Don't leave.*

I feel colder without her embrace. "It was my fault… I should have been more prepared."

Pinkie doesn't respond.

"Pinkie?"

"Yes?"

"Can you hold my hoof?"

***

Pinkie leads me into my home, closing the door behind us. She takes me to the couch and I sit down.

Pinkie asks, "What do you wanna do?"

My stomach grumbles, giving me the answer. "Eat."

"Gotcha, what do you want?"

"Anything, I'm starving."

"Okie dokie lokie, just sit tight and Pinkie will make you something delicious."

I hear Pinkie walk away to the kitchen as I am left alone with my thoughts.

*I'm glad Pinkie didn't get blinded too.*

*She doesn't deserve that.*

*Well, at least this condition is temporary, and I have a good friend to help me through it.*

*I'm going to have a lot of time to think.*

*And no time to read!*

*No reading…*

*Maybe Pinkie will read to me?*

*She probably would, but I don't think she'd like reading my usual books.*

*We could read fiction?*

*I'll let her pick the book, she'll have to read it aloud after all.*

I get distracted by a smell from the kitchen, I can't quite tell what it is.

*I should walk to the kitchen, I am going to need to eat in there anyway.*

*Plus, this could be a good test to see how I handle walking by myself.*

*Yes, good idea, Twilight.*

I stand up with confidence.

*Ha, you got this.*

Then I immediately trip on my first step, face-planting to the floor.

*Ow.*

I get back up, bruised ego and all.

*Let's try that again.*

I slowly walk, feeling my way with my hooves, trying to remember the layout of my tree house.

I bump into a lamp.

_Oh, I know this lamp. I bought this last winter and put it on the bookshelf near my writing desk. That should mean the kitchen is to my right._

I turn right and carefully walk forward, trailing my hoof on the wall to keep myself straight.

_Okay, if I remember right, the wall should end right about… here._

Just as predicted, my hoof no longer feels the wall. I reach back so my hoof hits the wall corner and slowly turn right until my hooves feel the floor change to the familiar kitchen tile.

_Now to find the table._

I shuffle my way deeper into the kitchen.

*The table should be to my left.*

I walk forward a little more and turn left. Walking forward, I crash into something.

I panic and grab onto it, falling on top of it.

"Ah," I say in unison with the object I hit.

I take a moment to settle down, releasing my death grip on whatever I landed on.

*I don't like being blind.*

"Pinkie?" I call out as I lay my head on the object under me.

*This is really soft, what's it doing in the kitchen?*

"Twilight, are you okay?" my pillow asks.

*Pinkie!*

"I'm so sorry, Pinkie…"

"It's okay, let's get you up and to the table, come on," Pinkie says before helping me to the table.

"Thank you."

"You gotta be careful, Twilight."

"I will."

Pinkie goes back to making food, as I can hear her making noise at the stove.

"What do you wanna do after we eat?"

"I was thinking maybe you could read me a book?"

"Oh, that sounds fun, what book?"

"I was thinking you could pick, since you are the one reading it."

"I'll be sure to pick something fun!"

"I can't wait," I say as a smile forms on my lips, the first one since becoming temporarily blind.

"Do you want to lay down in bed for it? It can be your bedtime story!"

I yawn and get my answer. "Sure."

*Sounds cozy.*

"Yay!"

"What are you making?"

"Pancakes."

"Sounds delicious."

"Yep!"

I sit quietly and think about my situation some more.

*Not much left in the day, being in the hospital took up most of the day.*

*And the accident took up most of my energy.*

*So, my current schedule is: eat, listen to story, sleep.*

*That sounds good to me.*

I am about to continue my train of thought when something brushes against me, startling me immensely.

"Ah!" I say as I turn to look at whatever it is, only to remember my inability to see.

Pinkie hugs me as my heart returns to my chest, "Shh."

"Sorry…"

She hugs me a little tighter before letting go, saying, "It's okay, nothing to apologize for."

I turn my head and stare at where my hooves should be. "How's the food coming along?"

"Almost done," she says in a cheerful tone.

"Thank you."

"Anything for a friend!"

After a few moments of silence, I hear Pinkie slid something onto the table in front of me. Feeling the heat emanating off it, I deduce it is the pancakes.

Doing my best, I levitate the top pancake and take small bites slowly.

*This is delicious.*

I hear a stifled giggle as I poke myself in the cheek with the pancake for the third time in a row.

Sighing, I put the pancake down and on the plate, and start eating like an earth pony.

I finish my first pancake, then stop to compliment Pinkie. "These are really good, thank you."

"Aww, thank you. They are made with love."

I smile at her. "I can tell."

I feel my cheeks heating up. *Hmm, what's that from?*

I go back to eating as I hear Pinkie do the same.

After finishing the rest of my pancakes, I yawn. "I'm ready to lay down, how about you, Pinkie?"

"I'm ready to read you an amazingly awesome story, let's go!"

I stand up with a smile before Pinkie comes over to me and puts a hoof over my shoulder. She guides me into the other room and to the stairs.

Taking it slow, we make it up the stairs, Pinkie helping every step of the way.

Pinkie leads me over to my bed before saying, "Okay, get in bed and I'll tuck you in nice and snug."

I was about to protest, but the idea of being tucked in by a loving friend sounded kinda nice after what happened today.

I simply nod before getting in bed.

Pinkie carefully pulls the blanket over me, then tucking it under my sides. "There, now to read you a super fun story."

"Do you have one picked out already?"

"I do, I just need to go find it, I'll be right back."

I nod before I hear her trot away.

*Knowing Pinkie, it will be a fun story.*

I smile as I think about my friend.

*She cares so much.*

*She blames herself for my condition... but it's my fault.*

*I can't let her think that.*

*I need to show her the same emotions she is pouring into me, but how?*

I don't get time to think about it as Pinkie returns with glee.

"I'm back!"

I try to match her energy and smile. "Welcome back!"

I feel her sit down on the side of my bed.

"You sure are smiling a lot for a pony who just went blind."

"It's hard not to when the funnest pony in Equestria is your caretaker."

Pinkie asks with a ting of bashfulness, "You really mean that?"

"Yes."

As I expected, a few seconds later I am wrapped in a tight hug, ruffling the blanket out of place.

I return the hug, nuzzling her.

As we hug, my stomach feels weird, all woozy, and I get this urge to hold the hug forever, not wanting to let go.

I hold the hug a bit longer than normal, but eventually let go.

*That was weird.*

Pinkie, without question, fixes my dishevelled blanket, re-tucking it under my sides.

I can't help but smile even wider from how much she cares. "Thank you."

"You're welcome, Twilight."

"What book did you pick out?"

"I picked a really short one since you look so tired, I hope that's okay?"

"Yes, Pinkie, that's alright."
