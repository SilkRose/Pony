## Short Description:
Twilight is struggling to laminate her marriage certificate, while Rainbow struggles to make coffee. Maybe they just need each other to help out.

## Ideas:
- Twilight can't press start on the lamination because of mental hurdles.
- Rainbow can't make coffee because of physical hurdles.
- The hurdles are such so that you would expect them to be reversed.
- Twilight is smart and usually can think through a problem.
- Rainbow is strong and can usually do any physical task given.
- They are married, and know each other well, so they turn to each other for help.
