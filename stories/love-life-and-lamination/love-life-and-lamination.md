# Love, Life, and Lamination

Rainbow and I stand in front of our lamination machine.

Rainbow asks, "What are you laminating, Twilight?"

I answer, "Our marriage certificate."

"Cool, I'm going to make coffee while you do that. Want some?"

"Sure, thank you." I pull her into a hug before she leaves.

She hugs back. "I love you."

"I love you, too!"

After the hug, Rainbow left the room, and it was just me, the marriage certificate, and the lamination machine now.

I place the certificate neatly onto the input tray.

*Okay, Twilight, this is it.*

I go to press the start button, and just can't.

*Come on, Twilight, you can do it.*

I try again, and can't press it.

By the letter of Celestia, by the words of all my friends, by the vows of my wife, I was married.

With all that in mind, this should be easy, yet it wasn't. This should just be another task of documentation processing, but no, this was *lamination.*

I love Rainbow Dash, and she loves me. So, why was this so hard?

I've been with Rainbow for many years now. We've gone thought so much together, countless memories of the good times and the bad. We've learned so much about each other and about friendship. Being with her has changed my life for the better.

So, there is no way it could be Rainbow Dash.

*What does laminating this marriage certificate change?*

Realistically, nothing. For me, though, it marked a significant change in my life. It marked the end of the previous chapter and the start of the next. But why was that so scary?

I leave Twilight to go make our coffee.

Twilight normally makes our coffee, but I've watched her do it hundreds of times, so I have to know how to do it by now, right?

I get to the machine and immediately realize I have no idea what I'm doing.

*Uh, I think the first thing she does is put water in it.*

I use the pot and fill it up with water, before pouring said water into the water reservoir on the back of the coffee machine.

*That was easy, maybe I learned more from Twilight than I thought.*

Okay, next is, uh, the coffee, yea.

I place the pot back on the burner and pull out the coffee holder thing.

I thought the inside part of the holder was supposed to be white, but it was just black plastic. I must be misremembering.

I get out the coffee and scoop out two lots of coffee.

As I'm about to put the coffee holder back, I realize the machine has already started dripping water into the pot.

*Oh, shoot.*

I quickly put the coffee holder back, only a little bit of water had made it into the pot.

*Phew.*

As I let the coffee make, I get out our favorite cups from the cabinet.

*What were the measurements she used again?*

*Something about a spoon, I think.*

I get out a spoon and use it to scoop out sugar and cream into both our cups.

I put six spoons in my cup of each and eight spoons in her cup of each.

*That should be right.*

I put the spoon down and watch the water dripping into the pot.

*Why is there so much stuff floating in the coffee?*

*It must dissolve when it's stirred, that's it.*

It was at that moment, I realized the light is still off.

*Oh, no. I hope it's fine to turn it on this late.*

I flick the switch and wait for the coffee to be done.

I carefully pour our two cups, stirring afterward.

After I think I'm done, I look down at our cups and realize something is wrong.

The coffee stuff was still floating at the top.

*That can't be good.*

*Maybe I need some help.*

I sigh and trot defeated back to Twilight.

I decide to get some help from Rainbow, but before I can call for her, I hear somepony trotting towards me. I look and see Rainbow Dash.

Rainbow gets to me and says, "I'm having some trouble with the coffee machine, do you think you could help?"

"Sure, but could you help me real quick, first?"

She smiles at me. "Sure."

"Just press the start button for me."

Rainbow presses the start button and the machine whirs to life.

She turns to me and wraps me in a loving embrace. "I love you."

I blush and wrap my hooves around her in turn. "I love you, too."

We kiss as the machine toils away in the background. As we kiss, I realize how silly my worries were. All I needed was help from my best friend.

We break the kiss and I ask, "Ready for some coffee?"

"Absolutely."
