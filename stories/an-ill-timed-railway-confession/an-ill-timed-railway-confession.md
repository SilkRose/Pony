# An Ill-timed Railway Confession

Pinkie and I take turns pressing down on the mechanical handles of the manual hoofcar we are operating to get back to civilization. Pinkie's constant droning on about chimicherry and cherrychanga is driving me nuts. 

Pinkie asks, "What do you think, Rarity? Chimicherry or cherrychanga? Chimicherry, cherrychanga? Chimicherry, cherrychanga? Chimicherry, cherrychanga? Chimicherry, cherrychanga?"

Pinkie continues talking as I say, "When I get back, you're gonna get it, Rainbow Dash!"

After a few more seconds of Pinkie's nonsense, I can't take it. "Pinkie Pie!"

"Yes, Rarity?"

"Can we talk about something else?"

Pinkie goes unusually quiet as we continue down the tracks.

After a few more times pressing down the handle, I have to ask, "What? Did I say something wrong, darling?"

Pinkie looks me in the eyes. "No, I just have something I need to tell you."

"What is it? I'm always here for you."

Pinkie presses her handle down extra hard. "Rarity, I really really really really like you."

I'm a little surprised, not expecting a confession at a time like this. "Pinkie, are you saying what I think you are?"

I didn't need an answer though, I could see the blush on her face. She is rather cute with a blush.

"Yes, I think you're so super duper pretty and I want to date you."

Now it's my turn to blush.

I stop pressing the handle down and Pinkie follows suite. We drift down the track slowly coming to a stop.

After the hoofcar stops, I get down onto the ground. "Let's take a break and talk about it, sound good?"

"Okey dokey lokey."

I sit down and gesture for her to sit in front of me, and she does so.

"Pinkie, I'll save you the stress of waiting and just say this before we start: Yes, I will go out with you."

Pinkie hugs me ecstatically. "Yay!"

I hug back and nuzzle her.

She holds the hug extra long, squeezing tight.

After the hug, I ask, "How long have you felt this way?"

"A long time, more than a month!"

I take her hoof and hold it. "Why didn't you say something sooner? This isn't exactly the most romantic place to ask somepony out." I gesture at the barren desert around us.

"I've wanted to ask you for a while, but was too nervous to do it. That's why I was going on about chimicherry and cherrychanga. I thought if I kept talking I wouldn't think about how much I wanted to be with you."

"I take it that it didn't work?"

"No, every time I looked up from pressing the handle down… I was reminded how pretty you are."

I blush again. "You know, you're super duper pretty too."

Pinkie smiles at me and blushes. "I'm sorry I made you catch me. You were the only pony on my mind so I just said for you to catch me."

"It's alright. I'm glad you did."

"It was really nice. you're really soft."

I giggle. "I'm glad I could break your fall, and you're soft too, you know."

"Thank you."

I kiss her cheek. "I certainly wasn't expecting to get a romantic confession in the middle of the desert miles away from civilization, but I'd be doing both of us a disservice if I didn't give it a shot."

Pinkie's blush intensifies. "Thank you for being so amazing!" She kisses my cheek.

I pull her into a hug. "Absolutely, darling."

Pinkie hugs back and whispers, "Chimicherry…"

"What was that?"

"Still a little nervous, hard to believe this is happening."

I whisper, "Say it again."

"Chimicherry."

I nuzzle her cheek. "Cherrychanga."

"Chimicherry."

"Cherrychanga."

We both giggle and stare into each other's eyes.

I almost get lost in her eyes, but instead I pull her close, wrapping my hooves around her. I hold her head to my chest.

I nuzzle the top of her head and she nuzzles my chest.

I can hear the tears in her voice. She says, "Thank you."

I kiss the top of her head. "Thank you."

I close my eyes and tighten my hold on Pinkie.

We enjoy the moment for a long time, neither of us speaking.

Eventually I sigh. "As much as I want to stay like this with you, we should probably continue heading back."

I let go of her and she looks at me a little sad.

I say, "I'm sorry."

Her ears perk up. "Rarity?"

"Yes, darling?"

She asks bashfully, "Can we kiss before we go?"

"Absolutely."

We lean forward as our eyes are locked on each other. Before our lips meet, Pinkie wraps her hooves around me, holding me tight.

We both blush as our lips meet.

I get lost in her eyes as a few tears escape me.

I could get used to this. She's a good kisser.

We hold the kiss for a while, but eventually Pinkie breaks it. "Wow."

"Wow, indeed, darling."

"Sorry for repeating it so much, but thank you!"

"No worries, darling. I'm very glad you said something."

We let go of each other and stand up stretching.

I get up onto the hoofcar and Pinkie follows. We start down the tracks again.

Pinkie looks at me with a smile. "What should we talk about now?"

I can only think of one thing. I smile back at her. "Chimicherry."

"Cherrychanga."

"Chimicherry."

"Cherrychanga."

"…"

We make it back to civilization, the second half of the trip having us in much better spirits than the first. We smiled and blushed at each other a lot more.
