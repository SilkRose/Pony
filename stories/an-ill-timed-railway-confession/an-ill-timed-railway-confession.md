# An Ill-timed Railway Confession

Pinkie and Rarity take turns pressing down on the mechanical handles of the manual hoofcar they are operating to get back to civilization.

Pinkie asks, "What do you think, Rarity? Chimicherry or cherrychanga? Chimicherry, cherrychanga? Chimicherry, cherrychanga? Chimicherry, cherrychanga? Chimicherry, cherrychanga?"

Pinkie continues talking as Rarity says, "When I get back, you're gonna get it, Rainbow Dash!"
