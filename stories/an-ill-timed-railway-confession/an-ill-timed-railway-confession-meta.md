# An Ill-timed Railway Confession

## Synopsis:


## Description:
Amidst chasing a runaway Applejack down the tracks of Dodge City, Pinkie Pie divulges her true feelings to Rarity, but perhaps miles away from the nearest stop isn't the proper time to court a lady.

Thanks to [Rego](https://www.fimfiction.net/user/180061/Rego) for thinking of the name, and writing the description.

## Short Description:
Pinkie confesses her feelings for Rarity at a less than stellar time.

## Ideas:
1. Story starts after they pop up from the fall. The two wait for their friends to come back, but they don't.
2. Rarity is very angry about the whole situation wondering why Pinkie Pie asked RARITY to catch her when Twilight has better magic.
3. They wander a bit trying to get their bearings (finds railroad tracks). Pinkie points towards the direction they need to go (maybe know barren wastelands from living on a rock farm)
4. Rarity is both frustrated about the situation, worrying about themselves and Applejack. Pinkie Pie keeps trying to cheer Rarity up to no avail.
5. They find the railcar during an unwanted game of I spy/
6. They start working their way back to town. Rarity gets messier and messier from the exertion. Pinkie tries to help, but Rarity finally loses her patience and explodes.
7. Rarity realizes she let her temper get to her after Pinkie goes very quiet after a moment of introspection. She doesn't say anything, but dwells a bit on her regrets.
8. (After sprinkling hints throughout the story of how much Pinkie was trying her best to fix the situation) Rarity laughs, rousing Pinkie from her silence.

> Big Moment
>
> Rarity: "I'm dreadfully sorry, Pinkie Pie. This whole situation has been so draining and I took it out on you. I know you were just trying to cheer me up; it took me longer than it should've to appreciate that. I won't lie, I'm still angry, but I hope you can forgive me."
> Few dialogues later Pinkie: "But why did you laugh?"
>
> Rarity: "O-oh… it's silly really. I work with patterns all the time, you know, and I couldn't help but notice one with you. From you fixing my mane just how I do it myself to (some other Rarity-specific Pinkie nonsense). If I didn't know better, I'd say you were flirting with me."
>
> Pinkie: "Oh… hehe, yeah. That'd be… weird."
>
> (After another Description) Rarity: "Were… were you hitting on me?"
>
> Pinkie: *Bends down a little to hide her glowing blush behind the railcar lever's movement*

9. Rarity postpones the awkwardly-timed confession and says they can talk about it once they are back in civilization so she can look the part to accept a proper one. Pinkie offers to fix it now so she can get the unsaid "yes" right now, Rarity remains adamant that she must look presentable for a marefriend.
10. End.
