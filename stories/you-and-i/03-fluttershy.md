# Fluttershy

Fluttershy gently opens the door before peering inside. I wave her in, and she comes over to the bed after closing the door.

Fluttershy apologizes. "I'm sorry I'm so late."

I reply, "It's okay, I'm just so happy you're here."

Fluttershy smiles at this and I smile back before lifting the blanket for her. She gets in the bed and I set the blanket down around her.

I pull her close and nuzzle the top of her head. "You have a long day too?"

Fluttershy sighs, "Yes, it was so hectic. I've been looking forward to being able to see you all day."

"Me too. I was worried you weren't going to show up, but I'm so glad you did."

"Do you want to talk about your day?"

"I can do that, *but* there is one thing I'd like to do firstâ€¦"

Fluttershy lifts her head to look at me.

I lean forward slowly, and we press our lips together.
