# Rarity

Rarity enters my room in a hurry, closing the door behind her. She quickly makes it to my bed, already apologizing.

"I'm so sorry, Pinkie. I would have been here soonerâ€¦"

I stop her with a hoof. "It's okay." I lift the blanket for her. "I'm just happy you're here."

Rarity climbs in the bed and snuggles close to me as I let go of the blanket.

"Thank you. Truth be told, I've been looking forward to this all day."

"Me too, actually. I've had a long day."

"Well, I'm glad I made it in time."

I blush and kiss her on the lips.

She kisses back and wraps her hooves around me, holding me tight.

After the kiss, Rarity asks, "Did you want to talk about your day, or did you have something else in mind?"

I think for a moment, eventually saying, "Maybe in a minute, I've got a few more kisses with your name on them."
