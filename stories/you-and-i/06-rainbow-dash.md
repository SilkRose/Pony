# Rainbow Dash

Rainbow Dash trots inside, closing the door behind her. She quickly comes to the bed and rolls into bed. I wrap the blanket around her and pull her close.

I say, "Hi."

Rainbow replies, "Hey."

"I'm glad you made it, I've had a long day."

"Me too, I was flying fast to get here in time. I couldn't miss being with you."

"Thank you," I say before planting a gentle kiss on her lips.

Rainbow kisses me in return before smiling at me with a blush.

I ask, "Do you want to talk about your day?"

Rainbow pretends to think before saying, "Nah, we can do that later. I've got a cute pink pony to cuddle first."

I blush and give her a big hug. She hugs back with a slight giggle.

I nuzzle her cheek before we let go of the hug.
