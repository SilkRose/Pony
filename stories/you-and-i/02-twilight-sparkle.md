# Twilight Sparkle

Twilight Sparkle trots into my room, closing the door behind her. I smile at her as she makes it to the bed. She starts to apologize for being late, but I shush her with a hoof. After taking my hoof away, I lift the blanket, signalling her to climb under.

After she gets in the bed, I lower the blanket and pull her close. I smile at her, and she smiles back.

I say, "I'm glad you could make it, I missed you today."

Twilight replies, "Me too, I've been looking forward to this. It's been a long day."

I ask, "Do you want to talk about it?"

Twilight blushes. "Maybe in a bit, I want to do something first."

I blush slightly. "What is that?"

Twilight wraps her hooves around me and pulls me close. "Hold you and relax."

I nuzzle her. "Sounds great!"

Twilight kisses me and I kiss back.
