# You and I

You lay down in Pinkie's bed, Pinkie having scooted over to make room for you. Getting comfortable, you look at her and smile.

I see your smile and smile back.

You stare at Pinkie, mesmerized by her beautiful blue eyes, like at any moment you would get lost in a high seas adventure within them.

I scoot closer to you, wrapping a hoof around you.

"Hi," You say as you scoot closer to her in turn.

"Hi," I say in response, my smile getting wider.

With the formalities out of the way, you wrap your hooves around her, holding her tight.

I wrap my hooves around you in response, nuzzling you gently.

After the nuzzle, you kiss her cheek before watching her blush.
