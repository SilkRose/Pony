# You and I

You lay down in Pinkie's bed, getting comfortable. Laying your head on her pillow, you look at her beside you and smile.

I see your smile and smile back.

You stare at Pinkie, mesmerized by her beautiful blue eyes, like at any moment you would get lost in a high seas adventure within them.

I scoot closer to you, wrapping a hoof around you.

"Hi," You say as you scoot closer to her in turn.

"Hi," I say in response, my smile getting wider.
