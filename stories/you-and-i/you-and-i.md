# You and I

You lay down in Pinkie's bed, getting comfortable. You lay your head on Pinkie's pillow and look at her beside you, and smile.

I see you looking at me with a smile, and smile back.

You stare at Pinkie, mesmerized by her beautiful blue eyes, like at any moment you would get lost in a high seas adventure within them.

I scoot closer to you, wrapping a hoof around you.
