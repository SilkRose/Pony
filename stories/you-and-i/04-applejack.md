# Applejack

I hear a knock on my door before it opens, revealing Applejack. She comes in and closes the door. I smile at her, and she smiles back. I lift the covers, and she climbs under, scooting close to me.

She starts to apologize, but I stop her, saying, "It's okay Applejack, I'm just glad we can spend time together now!"

Applejack blushes. "Me too."

"I had a long day, so I've been looking forward to this all day."

"I did too, and I have been as well."
