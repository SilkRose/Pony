# Applejack

I hear a knock on my door before it opens, revealing Applejack. She comes in and closes the door. I smile at her, and she smiles back. I lift the covers, and she climbs under, scooting close to me.

She starts to apologize, but I stop her, saying, "It's okay Applejack, I'm just glad we can spend time together now!"

Applejack blushes. "Me too."

"I had a long day, so I've been looking forward to this all day."

"I did too, and I have been as well."

I wrap a hoof around her and pull her close before kissing her on the cheek.

Applejack blushes before kissing me on the lips. I kiss back and blush. Afterward, Applejack says, "I needed that after how sore my muscles are today's work."

I smile. "Glad I could help."

She boops me. "Thank you."

I giggle and hug her tight. She hugs back with a giggle of her own.
