# A Letter to Pinkie Pie

Dear Pinkie Pie,

I love you. I know that's a bold way to start a letter from someone you've never met. But, it's true. I love your attitude towards life. I love your desire to make everypony happy. I love the adorable way you pronk around instead of trotting like everypony else.
