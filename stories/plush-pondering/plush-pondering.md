# Plush Pondering

I stand in the front seat of my best friend's station wagon. My seatbelt is buckled like any other passenger, but only my best friend sees me that way. The top belt over my head and flank, while the bottom belt is around my hooves. I stare ever constantly out the window, watching the scenery go by. With only the view and my best friend beside me, I do the only thing I can, think.

What does it mean to be sentient? Are other inanimate objects sentient, or is it just me? Would they say I am sentient? Does my best friend know I can think? What would they say if they knew I could think? What would I say if I could speak?

I know not the answers to these questions. The kind that come out on long car rides like this one. The kind that keep a plush up at nightâ€¦ Well, if a plush could sleep they would keep them up at night. As I get past my inability to sleep, another string of questions enters my mind.

Who is Pinkie Pie? I know that's my name, but am I really her? Do I have any real connection to her? Do I exemplify any of her qualities? I look like her, but is it just a facade, imprisoned upon by my creators?

I am her, whether I like it or not. I am seen as Pinkie Pie, so her, I must be. For it I weren't truly her, would I not live in constant dysphoria? But, no, I like being the pink one. Her personality gleamed from my best friend and the sparing times I've seen the media I'm based off of, fits me well.

As a love-themed gas station rolls past my vision, another set of questions materializes in my mind. Why does my best friend love me? Do I love them back? Would I be there for them if I had agency in my life? Would they be there for me? What problems does a plush even have?

We've been best friend since day one, and I suspect they feel the same way. It has been over a decade since we met. I'd be lying to myself if I said I didn't love them, they are my best friend after all. I would still be there for them, no matter what, even if I could walk and talk, I'd be talking to my best friend, and walking to give them a hug. I know they'd be there for me, they already are without even knowing it.

The last question repeats in my head, unanswered. What problems do I have?



As the car comes to a halt, I realize we are home. What was the point of all that pondering? Am I to live in constant existential wonder, or will I yet find peace in my life? Before I can finish my thought process, my door is opened.

My best friend unbuckles me and says, "I love you," before they picks me up.

I love you too!

Maybe it's not worth worrying about, after all, my life is pretty good for a Pinkie plush.

As I'm carried through the air, held by the person I care most about, only one thought is running though my head.

Wheeeeee!
