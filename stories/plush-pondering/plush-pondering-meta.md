## Short Description:
What does it mean to be a plush? What does it mean to be Pinkie Pie?

## Ideas:
- The plush starts asking questions with no answers.
- The questions transition to ones she answers.
- Eventually the questions subside and her thoughts are all that's left.
- The ending is her realizing it doesn't matter and she should just be happy.
- The story focusing on existential questions, like what is real, who I am, etc.
