# Love Licks

I sit in my study reading a book entitled, 'The Construction of Languages'.

I notice somepony opening the door, but as the words fly by, I forget to look. I can feel a presence beside me, I glance at them for a second before I finish the paragraph I am on.

I see Pinkie staring at the book I'm reading, a quizzical look on her face. I stop reading to look at her, she has already turned to me and is leaning closer to me.

Lick.

I sit stunned for a second, as I process what Pinkie just did, she *licked* my face.

*What?*

I open my mouth to ask why she had done so, when she closes my mouth with her hoof, instead pointing to the book. I look at the book as she closes it and motions over the title with her hoof, 'The Construction of Languages'.

She leans close again and licks me once more as I try to connect the two instances.

*Language? Lick? What is she doing? How are they connected?*

*Language? Lick? Language? Lick?*

*Language lick? Language lick?*

*Lick language? Lick language?*

*Aha!*

She's trying to make a language out of *licks*… what?

She looks at me with pleading eyes, as if she knows I realize what she is trying to do.

Am I really about to do this?

Lick.

Yes, yes I am.

Pinkie looks at me a little surprised with a big smile on her face. I look back, shocked that I am actually doing this. She hugs me.

I start to think, what should the first word be in this language? Probably a greeting, how about, 'Hello'.

I turn to Pinkie.

*How do I convey what I want to make a word for to Pinkie if I can't talk? Hmm.*

*Charades, yes, we will act out the word until the other one gets it, then assign it a lick onto the other pony.*

I put my hoof on Pinkie's back and lead her to the door, stepping out the door, she gives me a confused look. I look at her with a smile and node. I knock on the door then point to her, after a few seconds she gets it, nodding back. I close the door and wait for her to knock.

Knock, knock, knock.

I open the door with a smile and instead of saying, 'Hello', I lean close to her and lick upward an inch from her nose.

I lean back from the encounter, and she smiles at me, letting me know she understands.

I lead her back inside and go over to a chalkboard. I write down, 'Hello: A vertical lick upward one inch to the left or right of the nose.'

I point to Pinkie, indicating it's her turn.

Pinkie thinks for a second before coming over to me. She licks downward one inch from my nose, then waves at me and walks away.

*Goodbye.*

I write it down on the chalkboard. Pinkie nods, confirming I got it right.

*Aha, that's our next word.*

I nod at Pinkie before licking her upward on her chin.

She nods before licking my chin from side to side, shaking her head afterward.

*Yes and no.*

I lick her chin upward, confirming my understanding, before I write them both down.

*'I,' should be next.*

I point at my eye with a hoof before I lick horizontally under her right eye.

Pinkie gets it immediately. She points at me before licking horizontally under my left eye.

*I and you.*

I write them down and start to think of the next word.

*How should we handle names?*

*Aha!*

I go to Pinkie and point to her twice, trying to emphasize that it's her. I lick on her left cheek a 'P', for Pinkie and on her right cheek a 'P', for Pie.

She licks upward on my chin before licking my initials onto my cheeks.

*We make a great team!*

I write down, 'Names: Write initials on cheeks.'

I point at Pinkie, letting her know it's her turn.

She thinks for a second before pointing at herself a bunch before she pokes my right cheek twice.

*It's not I, or you, or her name…*

*Me!*

I write it down and wait for her confirmation to start on the next word.

*Hmm.*

*Maybe a nicety?*

*Please.*

I do my best pleading face, hoping she gets it. I lick the left side of her neck.

She licks, 'Yes.'

I write it down and double check with her, making sure she got it.

She stares at the chalkboard for a few seconds before her face changes to, *I have an idea* mode.

She comes over to me and licks, 'Please,' before drawing an ampersand on my cheek, then she licks my right side of my neck before licking, 'you.'

*Please and thank you.*

*She just did two words at once, amazing!*

I write them down and Pinkie nods with a smile.

As I think of the next word, an idea comes to me.

*Maybe we can include physical touch in general and not just licks.*

I hug her then lick, 'me.'

Pinkie looks at me confused, so I repeat the process.

Pinkie hugs me, letting me know she understands.

I write down, 'Hug: A hug.'

Pinkie looks back and forth from me to the board, thinking.

Pinkie leads me to the door, she opens it and points outside.

*Outside, yes.*

She leans close and licks a long line from the edge of my mouth on the right side to the side of my head.

I nod and write it down.

Pinkie shakes her head at the board, then erases 'side' from outside.

*Oh.*

I think about what should be next.

*Let's do 'a', but how? Maybe a common phrase?*

*What phrase has 'a' and words we've used?*

*That's it.*

I lick above her nose, a vertical line upward between her eyes, then hug her, then I lick, 'and,' then I repeat the lick for 'a.' After I finish by kissing her cheek.

*A hug and a kiss.*

*I can do two at once, too.*

Pinkie blushes as she stares at me for a moment, before nodding.

I write it down before turning back to Pinkie.

*She looks cute when she's blushing.*

Pinkie looks at me, then the board. She licks, 'I,' then licks her leg, then licks, 'you.'

*I lick you?*

Pinkie repeats the motions, but this time for the middle one she licks upwards on my lips.

Now, it's my turn to blush.

*I wonder if Pinkie thinks my blush is cute.*

I write it down and Pinkie nods. I notice her blush is still present.

*Hmm, what about numbers, those are important?*

I think on it for a second before booping Pinkie.

She looks at me confused.

I hold up one hoof, then boop her once, then I hold up two and boop her twice. I repeat it a third time for three.

Pinkie nods and I write it down.

Pinkie boops me three times, then twice, then once, then starts zooming around the room at high speeds.

*Three, two, one, go!*

I write it down and Pinkie licks, 'Yes.'

*I can use go in clue for the next word, probably.*

*Aha.*

*Go together.*

I lick, 'go,' before I pull us together, holding us and walking around the room.

Pinkie smiles at me before I lick, 'go,' again, then lick a loop de loop on her left cheek.

Pinkie licks it back on me before she grabs me and walks us around some, nuzzling my cheek.

I blush.

*That feels nice.*

After we finish walking, I write it down and Pinkie nods.

I look at Pinkie for the next word.

Pinkie starts walking on her hind legs, striking familiar looking poses and kissing her muscles.

*She acts very muscular.*

*Hmm.*

Pinkie comes back down on four legs and boops me twice before licking a V under my right eye, then licking, 'you.'

*Iron Will.*

*Will you?*

*That's it, will.*

I write it down on the board and Pinkie nods.

Pinkie's depiction of Iron Will inspires me. I decide to imitate Photo Finish.

*We.*

I try to convey, *we go.*

I flip my mane, before mock pushing Pinkie in front of me.

I lick ,'go.'

Pinkie seems confused.

*Maybe she wasn't there, hmm.*

I lick three vertical lines on her right cheek, before licking, 'go together.'

Pinkie's face lights up.

*Nice.*

I was about to go write it down when Pinkie kisses my cheek again.

I blush and don't know what to do, so I kiss her cheek back before writing the lick for 'we' down.

*I liked that… a lot.*

I look back at Pinkie, noticing her blush.

Pinkie licks, 'go,' before licking a V under my left eye, then licking, 'me.'

*Go with me?*

*With.*

I write it down and Pinkie nods.

*We are on a roll.*

*Should I do something similar to Pinkie?*

*How about us?*

I lick to Pinkie, 'You and me,' hoping she got it.

She points her hoof back and forth between us, nodding.

I lick a U on her right cheek.

Pinkie licks it back to me, before licking, 'Yes.'

I write it down and look back at Pinkie.

Pinkie looks at me as a blush forms on her face.

*What's she thinking?*

Pinkie licks, 'I,' before drawing a heart in front of her, then she licks, 'you.'

*I love you.*

I write down love and she nods.

Pinkie repeats it, this time replacing the heart with a kiss on the lips.

*So, that's why she was blushing.*

*Does Pinkie like me?*

I write it down and she nods.

*I kind of want to kiss her again…*

*Do I like Pinkie?*

*Aha!*

I lean in and lick, 'I love you,' before holding up two hooves.

*I love you, too.*

She nods, and I lick, 'I love you,' again before licking a U onto her left cheek.

*Totally wasn't an excuse to kiss her two more times.*

I write it down and Pinkie nods again.

Pinkie looks at me, and wraps her hooves around me. She licks, 'I love you.'

I'm confused by her not adding a word, so I just lick back, 'I love you, too.'

Pinkie licks, 'no,' before shaking her head. She licks, 'I *love* you,' tilting her head when she kisses me.

*Oh.*

Pinkie leans close and licks, 'Twilight Sparkle, will you go out with me?'

I blush fiercely as I think of what to do.

*I did really like kissing her, does that mean I like her?*

I make my decision, licking, 'yes, kiss me.'

Pinkie kisses me passionately, I reciprocate with my own newfound passion.

*I made a good decision.*

We break the kiss and I can only think of one word to lick to Pinkie.

'Love, love, loooooooove, love, love, love, love, *love, loooooove*, love, love.'

Pinkie looks at me as we both stare at each other, blushing madly.

She licks one word to me.

'You.'
