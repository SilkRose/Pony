# Unnamed Rarity x Rainbow Romance Story

I sit down on the train bench and watch as Rainbow sits opposite of me.

Wish she sat next to me, there is plenty of room.

I stare at her, taking in her beauty. I wonder if now would be a good time to confess my feelings.

Rainbow looks at me. I smile at her.

She smiles back before looking out the window. I notice the bored expression on her face.

*This must not do.*

I decide to channel a bit of Pinkie, trotting over and giving Rainbow a rather spontaneous hug.

Rainbow blinks, staring at me confused, before thankfully returning the hug. "Rarity, what's the hug for?"

I sit back down across from her after the hug. "You looked so bored, I had to do something."

"How does a hug make me less bored?"

I decide to test the waters. "Would it be less boring if we kiss?" I say with a smirk.

Rainbow looks at me in shock. "What?!"

She blushes and looked at me uneasily, ears half-folded back. "I can't tell whether you are joking or not."

I smile at her. "Well, a lady never tells, you'll have to kiss me to find out."

"What's gotten into you? Has somepony put you up to this?"

I lower my head and speak in a somber tone. "No."

Rainbow speaks quietly. "Well, I'm not bored anymore, so we're good."

*I guess we can talk about something else, then.*

"What do you have planned for when we get home?"

"I'll probably do some flying, and check in on our friends. What do you have planned?"

"I'll tell Twilight about our adventure in Canterlot, but after that, I plan to go to the spa and get some quality relaxing time in."

"I could definitely do with some relaxing too."

"You're always welcome to join me. I know it's not really your thing, but the invite stays all the same."

Rainbow took a second to answer. "I'll think about it."

I smile at her. "What trick have you been practicing lately?"

Her face lights up, and she starts talking about a new trick she's been working on, even doing a little demonstration with her hooves.

I listen attentively and nod along as her smile grows with each detail.

*She's so cute when she's excited.*



Rainbow gets flustered. "That's not what I said, I don't know."

My smile returns. "So, you do *like* me?"

Her blush intensifies. "Do you like me or something?"

I blush. "I said you'd have to kiss me to find out."

"What if I don't want to kiss you?"

"The blush on your face says otherwise, darling."

"What about the one on your face, what's it saying?"

I wink at her. "Why don't you kiss me and find out?"

"What happens after we kiss?"

"You'll see afterward."

"You really want to kiss me, don't you?"

"Only one way to find out."

Rainbow spoke just above a whisper. "I've never kissed anypony."

I smile at her. "Neither have I."

Her blush deepens. "You really want me to be your first?"

My blush grows. "Kiss me, and find out."

Rainbow gets up and comes close to me. She puts her front hooves on the seat to my sides.

Our faces are mere inches away from each other. I can feel her breath on my face. I lift my front hooves and wrap them around her.

I pull her closer, our lips a scant few millimeters apart. We stare into each other's eyes.

I dare not move anymore. I want her to press our lips together.

After a few seconds of stillness, Rainbow kisses me. I kiss back with passion. I tighten my hold on her, and she wraps her hooves around me.

We lock eyes as the kiss plays out. Both of us enamored with the other's touch.

As the kiss ends, Rainbow folds her ears back. She says in a low, weak voice, "That was awesome!"

I don't let go of her. Instead, I pull her into a hug. "It was amazing," I say serenely.

After the hug, she looks into my eyes. "Now, will you answer my questions?"

"Yes, darling."

She brings her face close to mine again. "I guess I'll start with the big one. Rarity, will you go out with me?"

I don't answer, I simply press our lips together. We hold each other tight and close our eyes as Rainbow takes in my answer.

After the kiss, Rainbow asks another question, "Why didn't you just ask me out like a normal pony?"

"Wouldn't you say this was more fun, darling?"

"Well, yes."

"Do you have more questions that i can answer by kissing you? Those are my favorites."

"They're my favorite too," Rainbow says bashfully.

I decide to answer whatever question she was going to ask next prematurely. I press our lips together again, releasing ever more passion into the kiss.

We let this answer linger for longer, ears folding back as we hold each other tighter and tighter.

I break the kiss and ask, "Did you know," – I kiss her cheek – "that you are cute."

Her blush intensifies. "Hey, you're the cute one here!" She kisses my cheek in turn.

I hug her tight and nuzzle her. "I love you, Rainbow Dash."

She hugs me back, nuzzling me back. "I love you too, Rarity."
