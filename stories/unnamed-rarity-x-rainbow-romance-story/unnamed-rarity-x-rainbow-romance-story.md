# Unnamed Rarity x Rainbow Romance Story

I sit down on the train bench and watch as Rainbow sits opposite of me.

Wish she sat next to me, there is plenty of room.

I stare at her, taking in her beauty. I wonder if now would be a good time to confess my feelings.

Rainbow looks at me. I smile at her.

She smiles back before looking out the window. I notice the bored expression on her face.

*This must not do.*

I decide to channel a bit of Pinkie, trotting over and giving Rainbow a rather spontaneous hug.

Rainbow blinks, staring at me confused, before thankfully returning the hug. "Rarity, what's the hug for?"

I sit back down across from her after the hug. "You looked so bored, I had to do something."

"How does a hug make me less bored?"

I decide to test the waters. "Would it be less boring if we kiss?" I say with a smirk.

Rainbow looks at me in shock. "What?!"

She blushes and looks at me uneasily, ears half-folded back. "I can't tell whether you are joking or not."

I smile at her. "Well, a lady never tells, you'll have to kiss me to find out."

"What's gotten into you? Has somepony put you up to this?"

I lower my head and speak in a somber tone. "No."

Rainbow speaks quietly. "Well, I'm not bored anymore, so we're good."

*I guess we can talk about something else, then.*

"What do you have planned for when we get home?"

"I'll probably do some flying, and check in on our friends. What do you have planned?"

"I'll tell Twilight about our adventure in Canterlot, but afterward, I plan to go to the spa and get some quality relaxing time in."

"I could definitely do with some relaxing too."

"You're always welcome to join me. I know it's not really your thing, but the invite still stands all the same."

Rainbow took a second to answer. "I'll think about it."

I smile at her. "What trick have you been practicing lately?"

Her face lights up, and she starts talking about a new trick she's been working on, even doing a little demonstration with her hooves.

I listen attentively and nod along as her smile grows with each detail.

*She's so cute when she's excited.*

Rainbow finishes her impassioned explanation before smiling at me. We sit in silence for a moment before a blush starts to form on her face. She quickly averts her eyes to the floor, then back at me. "So, um, what new dress have you been working on?"

I regale her with my latest piece, describing it in vivid detail. I make sure to mention how good it would look on a blue pegasus. I don't let myself get too caught up in the dress, lest I might miss her attention.

I do notice the blush on her face has grown, but sadly, she noticed it too. She pretends to cough and hides her face.

I finish my answer before Rainbow changes the subject.
