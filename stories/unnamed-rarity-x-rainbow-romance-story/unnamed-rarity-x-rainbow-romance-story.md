# Unnamed Rarity x Rainbow Romance Story

Rainbow sat idly on the train, looking out the window with a bored expression on her face.

Rarity took note. *This must not do.*

She channeled her inner Pinkie and gave Dash a hug.

Dash hugged back, but was confused. "What's the hug for?"

"You looked so bored, I had to do something."

"How does hugging make me less bored?"

Rarity, decided to have some fun. "Would it be less boring if we kissed?"

Rainbow blushed and looked at Rarity uneasily. "I can't tell whether you are joking or not."

"Well, a lady never tells, you'll have to kiss me to find out."
