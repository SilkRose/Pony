# Unnamed Rarity x Rainbow Romance Story

I sit down on the train bench and watch as Rainbow sits opposite of me.

I wish she sat next to me. There's plenty of room.

I stare at her, taking in her beauty. I wonder if now would be a good time to confess my feelings.

Rainbow looks at me. I smile.

She smiles back before looking out the window. I notice the bored expression on her face.

*This must not do.*

I decide to channel a bit of Pinkie, trotting over and giving Rainbow a rather spontaneous hug.

Rainbow blinks, staring at me confused, before thankfully returning the hug. "Rarity, what's the hug for?"

I sit back down across from her after the hug. "You looked so bored, I had to do something."

"How does a hug make me less bored?"

I decide to test the waters. "Would it be less boring if we kiss?" I say with a smirk.

Rainbow looks at me in shock. "What?!"

She blushes and looks at me uneasily, ears half-folded back. "I can't tell if you're joking."

I smile at her. "Well, a lady never tells, so you'll have to kiss me to find out."

"What's gotten into you? Has somepony put you up to this?"

I lower my head and speak in a somber tone. "No."

Rainbow speaks quietly. "Well, I'm not bored anymore, so we're good."

*I guess we should talk about something else, then.*

"What do you have planned for when we get home?"

"I'll probably do some flying, and check in on our friends. What do you have planned?"

"I'll tell Twilight about our adventure in Canterlot, but afterward, I plan to go to the spa and get some quality relaxation time in."

"I could definitely do with some relaxing, too."

"You're always welcome to join me. I know it's not really your thing, but the invite still stands all the same."

Rainbow takes a second to answer. "I'll think about it."

I smile at her. "So, what tricks have you been practicing lately?"

Her face lights up, and she starts talking about a new trick she's been working on, even doing a little demonstration with her hooves.

I listen attentively and nod along as her smile grows with each detail.

*She's so cute when she's excited.*

Rainbow finishes her impassioned explanation before smiling at me. We sit in silence for a moment before a blush starts to form on her face. She quickly averts her eyes to the floor, then back at me. "So, um, what new dresses have you been working on?"

I regale her with my latest piece, describing it in vivid detail. I make sure to mention how good it would look on a blue pegasus. I don't let myself get too caught up in the dress, lest I might miss her expression.

I do notice the blush on her face has grown, but sadly, she noticed it too. She pretends to cough and hides her face.

I finish my answer and wait for Rainbow's response.

"Are you saying *I* would look good in the dress?"

"Well, come to think of it, you are a blue pegasus, and you're already so pretty. So, yes, I am saying that."

Her blush comes back in full force. "Thanks for the compliment."

"I would be ever so grateful if you considered modeling it for me. I'd love to see it on a real pony!"

"I'll consider it, I guess. Might take a lot to convince me."

"Oh, you know what would be absolutely delightful, if we went on a spa-date before you model the dress. Doesn't that sound like such fun?"

"What do you mean by spa... *date*?"

I avert my gaze and speak a little softer, "Well, 'date' could mean a lot of things."

"Are you suggesting we go on a romantic date, Rarity?"

I say sheepishly, "Maybe."

"So, you were serious about the kiss?"

I nod my head as a blush forms.

Rainbow goes quiet for a bit as she stares out the window again. I watch her out of the corner of my eye.

Eventually, she turns and looks at me. "Do you like me romantically?"

"Yes, darling."

"What was the point of the kiss thing? Seems a little *too* direct for you."

"I was trying to be more like you. But I guess it failed."

Rainbow chuckles. "You did alright."

"So, what do you say? Do you like me that way too?"

"We'll have to see how our first date goes to find out, right?"

I look up at her in shock.

She gets up and comes over and wraps me in a tight hug.

"Thank you!" I say as I return the hug.

"Don't thank me yet, we haven't even had our first kiss yet."

I whisper, "It will be my first-ever kiss."

Rainbow whispers back, "Mine too."

My blush intensifies tenfold as we hold the hug for a good while.

"So, are you ready?"

I ask, confused, "Ready for what?"

"Duh, our first kiss! You were trying to kiss me earlier, right?"

"Oh, yes, I would very much like that."

We let go of the hug and stare into each other's eyes. Taking in the moment, we slowly move our heads together until our lips meet.

I wrap my hooves around her and hold her tight. She wraps her wings around me in response.

We hold the kiss as I get lost in her beautiful eyes.

Sadly, it has to end at some point, and we break the kiss.

Rainbow says in a rather soft voice I'm not used to hearing from her, "That was awesome!"

I giggle and nod my head. "Very much so."

We stare at each other in silence for a moment. I hold her hoof in my own. "Thank you, Rainbow Dash."

"No, thank you, for being brave enough to hit on one of your best friends while on a train."

"Well, even still, thank you for saying yes."

"Rarity?"

"Yes?"

"Thank you for being so cute."
