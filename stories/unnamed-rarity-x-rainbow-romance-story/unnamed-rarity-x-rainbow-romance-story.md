# Unnamed Rarity x Rainbow Romance Story

I sit down on the train bench and watch as Rainbow sits opposite of me.

She should have sat next to me. Well, I guess if she did, i would have a harder time looking at her beauty.

She is beautiful. I wonder if now would be a good time to confess my feelings.

Rainbow looks at me. I smile at her.

She smiles back.



I look at Rainbow, who is looking out the window with a bored expression on her face.

I took note. This must not do.

I channel Pinkie and give Rainbow a hug.

Dash hugs back, but is confused. "Rarity, what's the hug for?"

I sit back down across from her. "You looked so bored, I had to do something."

"How does a hug make me less bored?"

I decide to have some fun. "Would it be less boring if we kiss?"

Rainbow blushes and looked at me uneasily. "I can't tell whether you are joking or not."

"Well, a lady never tells, you'll have to kiss me to find out."

"What's gotten into you? Has somepony put you up to this?"

I lower my head and speak in a somber tone. "No, why? Do you not want to kiss me?"

Rainbow gets flustered. "That's not what I said, I don't know."

My smile returns. "So, you do *like* me?"

Her blush intensifies. "Do you like me or something?"

I blush. "I said you'd have to kiss me to find out."

"What if I don't want to kiss you?"

"The blush on your face says otherwise, darling."

"What about the one on your face, what's it saying?"

I wink at her. "Why don't you kiss me and find out?"

"What happens after we kiss?"

"You'll see afterward."

"You really want to kiss me, don't you?"

"Only one way to find out."

Rainbow spoke just above a whisper. "I've never kissed anypony."

I smile at her. "Neither have I."

Her blush deepens. "You really want me to be your first?"

My blush grows. "Kiss me, and find out."

Rainbow gets up and comes close to me. She puts her front hooves on the seat to my sides.

Our faces are mere inches away from each other. I can feel her breath on my face. I lift my front hooves and wrap them around her.

I pull her closer, our lips a scant few millimeters apart. We stare into each other's eyes.

I dare not move anymore. I want her to press our lips together.

After a few seconds of stillness, Rainbow kisses me. I kiss back with passion. I tighten my hold on her, and she wraps her hooves around me.

We lock eyes as the kiss plays out. Both of us enamored with the other's touch.

As the kiss ends, Rainbow folds her ears back. She says in a low, weak voice, "That was awesome!"

I don't let go of her. Instead, I pull her into a hug. "It was amazing," I say serenely.

After the hug she looks into my eyes. "Now, will you answer my questions?"

"Yes, darling."

She brings her face close to mine again. "I guess I'll start with the big one. Rarity, will you go out with me?"

I don't answer, I simply press our lips together. We hold each other tight and close our eyes as Rainbow takes in my answer.

After the kiss, Rainbow asks another question, "Why didn't you just ask me out like a normal pony?"

"Wouldn't you say this was more fun, darling?"

"Well, yes."

"Do you have more questions that i can answer by kissing you? Those are my favorites."

"They're my favorite too," Rainbow says bashfully.

I decide to answer whatever question she was going to ask next prematurely. I press our lips together again, releasing ever more passion into the kiss.

We let this answer linger for longer, ears folding back as we hold each other tighter and tighter.

I break the kiss and ask, "Did you know," – I kiss her cheek – "that you are cute."

Her blush intensifies. "Hey, you're the cute one here!" She kisses my cheek in turn.

I hug her tight and nuzzle her. "I love you, Rainbow Dash."

She hugs me back, nuzzling me back. "I love you too, Rarity."
