# Hired

The rain beats down hard on Trixie as she approaches the only sign of life for miles: a small farmhouse. She trots quickly to the door and knocks rapidly.

*Come on, come on, let Trixie in.*

An older stallion answers the door after a moment.

"Can I come in?" Trixie chokes out with all the confidence she can muster.

"Surely."

Trixie rushes inside, not caring for manners, as she barges past the stallion.

Trixie takes a moment to collect herself as she levitates off her signature hat and cape, wringing the water from them before paying attention to the stallion.

The stallion speaks up, "What is thou doing out in such weather?"

"Trixie was told I could find work here. She just came at a bad time."

"Aye, we do need another set of hooves."

Trixie asks with a hint of sheepishness, "What is the job again?"

"Rock farming."

"Rock farming… seriously?"

"We take thine work seriously, young mad'am."

"Okay, whatever, I'll take the job."

"Are thou hungry?"

Trixie's stomach rumbles. "Trixie does require subsidence, yes."

"Come with me, I shall feed thee and explain rock farming," the stallion says before leading Trixie deeper into the house.

*Trixie likes free food.*

Trixie follows the stallion and sits down at their kitchen table. "So, what is your name?"

"I am called Igneous Rock Pie, son of Feldspar Granite Pie."

"You can call me the Great and Powerful Trixie!"

"Nice to meet thou, Trixie."

"Oh… um, likewise."

"Before I explain how to farm rocks, I should say this, magic is forbidden. Direct contact with magic stunts the growth within the rocks."

*What?*

"Trixie can't use her magic?"

"No, and my daughter will give you a heck of a time if she catches you using it."

"Who's your daughter?"

"I speak of my oldest daughter, Limestone Pie."

"How many ponies live here, anyway?"

"Four, five if you're counting you."

*Trixie sure did move fast.*

"When will Trixie meet these other ponies?"

"Tomorrow morning, unless though wakest in the night."

"Okay."

"Let me get thy rock soup, lest we be talking jaws all night."

"Rock soup?"

"A dish seldom served around Equestria, the rocks give the soup an earthy taste."

"Okay."

Igneous pulled a large pot out of the fridge, setting it on the stove. He turns the stove on before sitting down at the table.

Trixie asks, "How does one farm rocks?"

"Crystals grow within the rock, we cultivate the growth by tending to the rocks. We move them from field to field, to get the highest yields."

"How do you know when the rocks are done growing or whatever?"

"It's a skill like any other, my daughters will teach thee well."
