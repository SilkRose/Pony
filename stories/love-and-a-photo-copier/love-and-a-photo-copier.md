# Love and a Photo Copier

The whole friend group were in the library, each of us studying for something different and most likely boring.

I flipped to the next page of the book I wasn't reading. I occasionally look up and notice Pinkie looking at me.

She's probably just as bored as I am.

If only there was something else we could be doing.

Pinkie must have been reading my mind, because she asks, "Rainbow, can you help me go copy something page?"

I don't understand why she needs help, but I'm not complaining. "Sure."

I close the book withing saving the page I was pretending to be on and get up from the table.

Pinkie leads me to the photo copier, bouncing the whole way. When we get there, Pinkie turns around and hugs me tight.

I hug back. "What's up, Pinkie?"

"Not much, just wanted to let you know I care for you!"

Pinkie, you are too cute.

Where did that come from? Why am I blushing?

I shake my head and notice Pinkie is already copying something.

I wait by the end of the machine and wait for the copy to print. Picking it up I see it's a mish mash of layered papers, spelling out a new sentence.

I read it out loud, "Rainbow Dash, you are awesome!"

While I agree with the message, I have to ask, "Is this what you came to copy?"

"I wanted to have fun!"

"Me too, I guess."

I start to look around through the papers and magazines in the copier room. I find what I'm looking for and place it all down the the copy bed before hitting start.

Pinkie waits at the outlet with a giddy smile.

When did Pinkie's smile become so pretty?

I shake my head again. What is going on with me?

I get no answer as Pinkie picks up the paper and reads it aloud. "You too."

"Aww, thank you Rainbow." Pinkie hugs me again.

I hug back again, this time even tighter.

After the hug we trade places again and Pinkie looks for the right words for her next sentence.

As she places her pages on the scanner, I can't help but stare at her, lost in a trance.

Pinkie stares back at me, smiling sweetly.

I break out of the trance and pick up the new paper. "I like you, Dashie."

I use the paper to block Pinkie view of my blush.

What do I say?

I put the paper down and start looking for my own papers.

I like Pinkie?

I find the relevant papers and press start.

Pinkie waits patiently for the first time in her life, humming an adorable tune.

Pinkie reads the paper out loud. "I like you, too?"

She puts the paper down before holding my hand.

I blush and try to look her in the eye, but can't.

Where did these feelings come from? Does Pinkie *like* me?

Pinkie lets go and rummages for new papers to use.

I wait by the output as Pinkie arranges her next message.

Pinkie's hand was really soft. I kind of want to hold it again.

I pick up the paper. "Rainbow, I *like* you." The 'like' was titled at a forty-five degree angle.

Well, that confirms it.

I look at Pinkie, who smiles wide back at me.

I hug Pinkie, and hold her tight. What should I do?

An idea strikes me as I look down at Pinkie's back.

"Pinkie, can you go get me some tape?"

"Yes!" Pinkie leaves the copier room.

I hurriedly search the the words I need. Where am I going to find an arrow?

I find the three words I need and improvise an arrow before placing it all on the scan bed.

Hitting start I watch the door, ready to intercept Pinkie if she comes back to soon.

Luckily it prints in time, i look at it and smile. Perfect. I hide it and wait for Pinkie.

Pinkie returns and gives me the tape. She waits by the output as I remember it's my turn.

Oh yea, what should I say? Hmm.

That's it! I start to gather the words, and look for some individual letters.

After gathering it all, I smile at Pinkie.

This is a lot of fun.

I hit start and wait for Pinkie's reaction.

Pinkie picks up the output and reads it aloud. "I *like* you, too!" She even managed to voice the smile-shaped text I did for 'like'.

Pinkie blushes and hugs me again, this time the tightest of them all.

I take the opportunity to tape my makeshift message to her back.

After the hug we smile at each other before Pinkie starts working on her next message.

Pinkie places her message on the scanner and looks at me. Her face looks worried.

I hold her hand and smile at her. She smiles back and presses start.

I don't let go until the message is printed. I pick it up and read it out loud. "Rainbow Dash, will you go out with me?"

I blush more than ever before. Looking at Pinkie, she is smiling at me serenely.

I start to look around the room for what might be my last message. Hmm.

I find everything I need a look at Pinkie before assembling it on the scan bed.

As it scans I grab her hand and hold it tight. We smile at each other as we both already know my answer.

Pinkie waits patiently for the second time in her life.

Once it's printed, she picks it up with one hand and reads it out loud. "Yes!"

We are both full on blushing at this point. Pinkie jumps up and down in excitement.

Somehow the paper stays stuck to her back.

I settle her down and hug her tightly.

I never thought I would go to the copier and come back in a relationship, but here we are.

Sunset interrupts us. "What's goin on in here?"

We let go of the hug and shrug.

Sunset asks, "Why do both of you have signs on your back that say, 'cute and pretty'?"
