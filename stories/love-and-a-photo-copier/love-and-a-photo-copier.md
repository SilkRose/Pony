# Love and a Photo Copier

I sit in the library, surrounded by my friends. Each of us is studying for this or that different thing. As I pretend to read the book in front of me, I can't help but steal glances up at the person sitting across from me: Pinkie Pie.

*Come on Rainbow, just ask her out already.*

Yea, I've got a crush on Pinkie. It's been a couple of weeks now. I need to do something about it. The thing is, I can't entirely tell if she likes me back. The way Pinkie acts with me is pretty much what you might expect from someone who has a crush on you - but she acts that way with everyone.

On my next glance up, I notice Pinkie looking at me. I lock eyes with her, and she smiles at me. I smile back before Pinkie gets up and motions for me to follow. I get up and the moment I make it to her, she grabs my hand and pulls me away.

Sparks shoot up my arm and I feel a blush overtaking my face. I hold her hand as we walk, enjoying the moment. She looks back at me as we walk through the library, and I see the barest hints of a blush on her face as well.

Pinkie leads us down seemingly random aisles of books and even does a few literal circles, but eventually we stop in the printing room. She brings me to the end where the photo copiers are and lets go of my hand.

I am about to speak, but Pinkie silences me with a finger, then points at a copier. I don't understand what she means, but I keep quiet anyway. Pinkie starts looking through the box of papers waiting to be recycled.

She finds what she's looking for and produces some random old magazines. After setting them on the copier lid, she pulls a pair of scissors from her hair and begins to cut shapes out of the pages.

*What could she be doing?*

I don't have to wait long to find out, as she presses her cutouts on the scanning bed and closes the lid. She presses the copy button and looks at me with a smile. As the machine works, Pinkie gently holds her hand out towards me.

I take it in my own and pull her a little closer to me. My blush intensifies and I notice one forming on her cheeks, too. The moment stays in my mind, even though it lasted only seconds. The copy is finished soon and I am forced to let go.

I pick up the piece of paper and see what's on it. It says, "You're awesome," but each word has different colors and fonts. I realize this is what she used the magazines for. I flip the paper around and point at it before pointing at her.

Pinkie jumps forward and hugs me tight. I'm surprised, but I return the hug. Afterward, I set the paper down and decide to copy something for Pinkie. She definitely has a crush on me, and I owe her a compliment.

Pinkie waits as I search through the papers and magazines. I find the first letter quickly, a giant 'U'. The second was also easy, the letter 'r'. The last one was harder, but I eventually found it in a fashion magazine, the word 'pretty'.

After cutting them out, I construct the sentence on the scanner and hit start after closing the lid. I turn back to Pinkie just to admire her. She really is so pretty. I couldn't think of a better way to tell her.

Pinkie bounces excitedly as the paper finishes printing. She picks it up and reads it. Her blush grows as she sets the paper down and looks at me. I just smile at her and hold her hand, playing with it. She looks down at our hands and giggles.

Pinkie lets go and starts looking for her next sentence. I just stand by the end of the machine and stare at her, lost in thought.

*I can't believe this is real. I like Pinkie, and she likes me back! She looks so cute, especially when she's blushing. We held hands, multiple times. Her hands are so soft.*

*I never would have thought I'd feel like this. Rainbow Dash, in love.*

*Rainbow Dash, in loveâ€¦*

My blush takes over my face after that thought, but I don't try to hide it. Pinkie has just hit the start button. I smile and offer my hand to her this time. She takes it before using her other hand to blow me a kiss.

I kiss the back of her hand in response, and now it's her turn for a blush to take over her face. This just makes her look even more cute. We don't have much time to enjoy the moment as the paper finishes printing.

I pick up the paper. It says, 'cute & pretty', and has an extra heart that was cut out from a different magazine. I point at the paper and then point at Pinkie while tilting my head in a questioning manner.

Pinkie points at the paper, and then at me. I act like I'm thinking before point at the word 'cute' then I point at her. I repeat this again with the word 'pretty'. She does the same thing, but points at both of us.

I nod at her assertion and get an idea as I see some scotch tape next to the copier. I give Pinkie a hug, just so I can stick the 'cute & pretty' paper on her back with a piece of tape. Pinkie seems to notice and holds the hug for a long time as I hear the copier going off again.

I hold Pinkie and enjoy the moment, closing my eyes. I play with her hair some before I realize the paper is blocked almost completely by her hair. This realization makes me giggle. Pinkie giggles too as she pats my back.

We let go of the hug, and I look to see what Pinkie copied, finding nothing. I just go ahead and take my turn. I decide to act like Pinkie this time and start looking through the box. I want to surprise her with a hug.

It takes some time, but I eventually find the words I'm looking for in a magazine about parties. I also find two hearts to put around the message. Very Pinkie Pie indeed.

I arrange them and hit start before turning to Pinkie and winking. She just smiles at me and waits patiently. I smile back, but feel something on my back. I reach back and find a piece of paper.

It says 'cute & pretty', like the paper she made earlier. I check Pinkie's back, and the one I stuck there is still there. She giggles when she sees I have the paper. I giggle in return and tap the paper on her back. She finds her original copy and we both giggle even harder.

After we calm down, I get close to her and wait for her to pick up the next message. As she does, I quickly hug her with a tight embrace. She hugs back even tighter, almost crushing my spine. I kiss her cheek as the hug ends.

She blushes more as she starts to work on her next sentence. I watch as she finds her words easily. Pinkie cuts them out and places them in place before hitting start. While waiting for the copier, Pinkie does a clockwise twirl towards me.

She lands in front of me with a big smile and blush on her face. She places one hand on my shoulder and holds the other one out for me to grab. I hold her hand and she starts leading us in a dance, humming a gentle tune for us to dance to.

I follow her lead and get lost in her beautiful blue eyes. I can't look away, nor would I want to. Sadly the dance doesn't last very long, as the next copy is already finished.

I blink as I realize we both have tears in our eyes. I decide to do something I've always thought about. I reach into Pinkie's hair and pull out some tissues, and use them and wipe away both our tears.

Pinkie just giggles and smiles at me. I walk over to the paper and pick it up. It says, 'I love you'. I put the paper down and look at Pinkie. Her eyes are low, and her smile is weaker.

*She's still nervous after all this. I can fix that.*

I wrap my arms around her gently and pull her close. She looks up at me with curiosity overtaking her eyes. I silence all of her internal concerns with one action. I kiss her on the lips.

The joy immediately returns to her eyes, and she wraps her arms around me. We hold each other and the kiss for a while. After the hug I collect all the copies we made, and hold up the 'I love you' one and point to it, then to Pinkie.

Pinkie smiles and nods before doing the same but pointing at me.

*Pinkie Pie, you are so cute.*
