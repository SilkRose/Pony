# Love and a Photo Copier

I sit in the library, our group of friends surrounding me. Each of us studying for this or that different thing. As I pretend to read the book in front of me, I can't help but steal glances up at the person sitting across from me: Pinkie Pie.

*Come on Rainbow, just ask her out already.*

Yea, I've got a crush on Pinkie. It's been a couple of weeks now, I need to do something about it. The thing is, I can't entirely tell if she likes me back. The way Pinkie acts with everybody isn't all that different from what you might expect from someone who has a crush on you.

On my next glance up, I notice Pinkie looking at me. I lock eyes with her, and she smiles at me. I smile back before Pinkie gets up and nods for me to follow. I get up and the moment I make it to her, she grabs my hand and pulls me away.

Sparks shoot up my arm as I feel a blush overtaking my face. I hold her hand as we walk, enjoying the moment. She looks back at me as we walk through the library, the barest hints of a blush on her face.

Pinkie leads up down seemingly random isles of books and even does a few literal circles, but eventually we stop in the photo copier room. She brings me to the end where the printer outputs and lets go of my hand.

I am about to speak, but Pinkie silences me with a finger, then points at the photo copier. I don't understand what she means, but remain silent anyway. Pinkie starts looking through the box of papers waiting to be recycled.

She finds whatever she's looking for, what appears to be random old magazines. After setting them on the copier bed, she pulls a pair of scissors from her hair and begins to cut out pages from them.

*What could she be doing?*

I don't have to wait long, as she places down her cutouts on the scanner and closes the lid. She presses the copy button and looks at me with a smile. As the machine works, Pinkie gently holds her hand out towards me.

I take it in my own and pull her a little closer to me. My blush intensifies and I notice one forming on her cheeks. We enjoy the moment for as long as it lasts. Soon after the copy is finished, and I am forced to let go.

I pick up the piece of paper and see what's on it. It says, "You're awesome," but each word has different colors and fonts. I realize this is what she used the magazines for. I flip the paper around and point at it before pointing at her.

Pinkie jumps forward and hugs me tight. I hug back and squeeze her tight. Afterward, I set the paper down and decide to copy something for Pinkie. She definitely has a crush on me, and I owe her a compliment.

Pinkie waits as I search through the papers and magazines. I find the first letter quickly, a giant 'U'. The second was also easy, the letter 'r'. The last one was harder, but I eventually found it in a fashion magazine, the word 'pretty'.

After cutting them out, I construct the sentence on the scanner and hit start after closing the lid. I turn back to Pinkie and just admire her. She's so pretty, I couldn't think of a better way to tell her.

Pinkie bounces excitedly as the paper finishes printing. She picks it up and reads it. Her blush grows as she sets the paper down and looks at me. I just smile at her and hold her hand, playing with it. She looks down at our hands and giggles.

Pinkie lets go and starts looking for her next sentence. I just stand by the end of the machine and stare at her, lost in thought over *her*.

*I can't believe this is real. I like Pinkie, and she likes me back! She looks so cute, especially when she's blushing. We held hand, multiple times. Her hands are so soft.*

*I never would have thought I'd feel like this. Rainbow Dash, in love.*

*Rainbow Dash, in loveâ€¦*

My blush takes over my face after that thought, but I don't try to hide it. Pinkie has just hit the start button and was about to look at me. I smile and offer my hand to her this time. She takes it before using her other hand to blow me a kiss.

I kiss the back of her hand, and now it's her turn for her blush to take over her face. This just makes her look even more cute. We don't have much time to enjoy the moment as the paper finishes printing.

I pick up the paper. It says, 'cute & pretty', and has two extra hearts that were cut out from different magazines. I point at the paper and then point at Pinkie while tilting my head in a questioning manner.

Pinkie points at the paper, and then at me. I act like I'm thinking before point at the word 'cute' then I point at her. I repeat this again with the word 'pretty'. She pretends to think like me then does the same as me but points at both of us.

I nod at her assertion and get an idea as I see some scotch tape next to the printer. I hug Pinkie and quickly take a piece of tape and put the 'cute & pretty' paper on her back as a sign. Pinkie seems to notices and holds the hug for a long time as I hear the printer going off again.

I hold Pinkie and enjoy the moment, closing my eyes. I play with her hair some before I realize the sign is blocked almost completely by her hair. This makes me giggle as I realize, and Pinkie joins in as she pats my back.
