# Dewinged

Pinkie Pie sat in shock as she stared at the page of the open book in front of her. She had been like this for several minutes, unable to move, to comprehend the words she just read.

She read the words aloud, "All naturally born alicorns, and one third of both pegasi and unicorn births, are to be processed into earth ponies."

She muttered the words again, still not sure if she believed this book.

It had to be a lie, right?

She continued reading, "Pegasi due for processing are to be sedated and dewinged before the parents can see the child."

"Unicorns due for processing should be treated the same and dehorned."

"All naturally born alicorns to non-alicorn parents will be both dehorned and dewinged. Their power is too great to be focused into their magic or ability to fly."

Pinkie couldn't believe it, but she couldn't stop reading.

"The child's memories are to be wiped before and after the procedure, for extra precaution. If the parents are suspicious of anything, they are also served a memory wipe with new implanted memories of an earth pony birth."

As Pinkie finished reading that page, a memory bored its way into her brain.

She screamed in agony, clenching her head. The memories slowly trickled to her, she remembered them in flashes.

A pink horn focused her chaotic nature.

A pair of pink wings glided her though stale white walls.

Heavy leather straps being pulled tighter and tighter.

A mechanical saw whirring at an idle.

Pinkie tried to make it stop, but she couldn't. The memories were unlocked, and she would relive them.

"No, no, no!" Pinkie tried to scream.

*Why are they so vivid?*

*Was I an alicorn?*

*This can't be realâ€¦*

Before she could continue, more memories forced their way into her stream of thought.

A heavy spell being cast on me, over and over.

Being sedated but still awake.

Wings pulled apart as the buzzing got closer and closer.

Flesh tearing and bone crunching.

Trying to scream but being unable to move.

Wings twitching on the ground.

Pinkie clenched her sides, her memory unlocking a hidden pain.

She cried out from unrelenting pain, reliving every detail of her wings being detached.

"No, no. This can't be real."

The memories continued, unimpeded.

A metal saw grinding against my skull.

The most torturing headache ever experienced.

Her skull being split open.

The skin being peeled back.

Her horn being ground down to nothing.

A sander removing any trace of a horn ever existed.

Every last connection from the brain to the horn, cut.

Pinkie recoiled in pain, her head experiencing the pain from all that time ago.

She screams a most horrific gut-wrenching wail.

"Make it stop!"

The pain only grew as she writhed on the floor.
