# Dehorned, Dewinged

## Synopsis:
What if earth ponies weren't real and every one was a unicorn or pegasus that had their stuff removed. And the reason some earth ponies have magic is because their old magic had to go somewhere.

## Description:
What do you do when you realize the fact that your entire race doesn't exist?

## Short Description:
Earth ponies don't exist.

## Ideas:
- Pinkie finds a book detailing that earth ponies don't exist.
- They are manufactured to control the population.
- 1/3rd of unicorn and pegasi births are turned into earth ponies.
- All naturally born alicorns not from alicorn parents are converted.
- Pinkie is horrified, and reading the book unlocks memories.
- The book has a failsafe spell, meant to trap earth ponies who read it.
- Pinkie is teleported to Celestia at the end.
