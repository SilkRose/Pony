# Creative Freedom

## Synopsis:
Rarity is sad about how not popular a few or her newer dresses are. Luckily for her Applejack is there to listen.

## Description:
Rarity goes to Twilight in a time of need. With a good friend and a shoulder to cry on, can Rarity work out her creative conundrums?

The cover has nothing to do with the story, it is a personal showcase of my favorite textures I've made for [Love & Tolerance](https://love-tolerance.com/), a MLP:FIM-inspired resource pack for Minecraft.

This story is very personal to me and was written in collaboration with [6-D Pegasus](https://www.fimfiction.net/user/293755/6-D+Pegasus).

## Short Description:
Sometimes you just need to vent, and a good friend.
