# X Marks the Plot

The sun shines brightly down on all the happy ponies playing at the beach, a cool breeze accentuating the waves as they crash in. A lone pony, Pinkie Pie, sits at the far side and plunges her yellow plastic shovel into the sand, humming a tune with a smile. 

_I hope I find lots of treasure_, she thinks.

As she digs, the tide tickles her left flank with an elongated wave. She giggles before continuing to dig.

As the hole gets deeper and deeper, she begins to worry. _Maybe this spot isn't a good one_. But as soon as she finishes her thought, the shovel hits something in the sand.

"OOO, I found something!" Pinkie shouts ecstatically, shoveling faster. Moments later, she uncovers a small black tome with a red X on the cover. Carefully picking it up, she places it in her lap and blows the sand off it.

She opens the book to the first page. Finding a map, she gets excited.

"A treasure map!" she squeals as her mind races.

_What does it lead to? Bits, gems, candy? Or maybe cotton candy?_

Pinkie's eyes light up at the thought of discovering a candy-based treasure. "I must find it," she mutters, determined.

Standing up, she orients herself with the map before setting out on her grand adventure.

Following the map closely, her eyes dart back and forth between the dotted line on the map and her surroundings.

She walks by two pegasi and an earth pony, drawing a grand depiction of Celestia raising the sun. "Nice job, looks great!" she compliments.

Pinkie turns the corner and–

"Watch out!"

Looking up from her map, she sees a ball heading straight for her. Thinking quickly, she punts the ball, and it soars to the other side of the court, scoring a point for the side she trotted into.

Her side laughs and thanks her. She takes a bow before trotting off the other side of the court.

She continues her march forward, determined not to get distracted again. 

_I've got to find that treasure_.

She looks near the edge of the beach, where the Cutie Mark Crusaders are busy building a sand castle. Sweetie Belle takes notice and glances up at her curiously.

"Hi, Pinkie Pie, what are you doing?" she asks Pinkie.

"I'm looking for buried treasure!" Pinkie explains, waving the map.

"Oh, can we come with you, please?" Sweetie pleads in excitement.

"Sure!" 

The trio follows behind Pinkie as she leads them down the dotted line. They all stop as the path splits before them. After holding a vote, they decide to take the left path. As they travel down their new route, they run into a long line of sleeping ponies. Pinkie looks at the map, then back at the ponies.

"The line is right where they're sleeping; we have to go over," Pinkie says before she hops over each of the sleeping ponies one at a time. The Cutie Mark Crusaders follow behind her, doing the same.

The path rejoins as they get close to the water. Pinkie leads them slightly into the water, where she sighs in relief as the cool water works wonders for her. Pinkie prances along the path in the water, enjoying the water splashing her.

The Cutie Mark Crusaders follow behind her, splashing each other and giggling happily as they go.

They turn back to land and make their final turn. Trotting forward some distance, they reach the X on the map. Barely able to contain her glee, Pinkie shouts, "We're here!"

The Cutie Mark Crusaders start digging immediately, the three fillies digging wildly in the sand with their hooves. Pinkie joins in, digging with her shovel as she giggles.

"This is so exciting!" Scootaloo says.

"I know, right!" Sweetie Belle comments.

"I can't wait to see what it is," Apple Bloom says.

Before Pinkie can even start to think of what treasure awaits them, her shovel stops in its track, hitting something in the sand. "We found it!" Pinkie shouts, clearing more sand around the item.

Pinkie clears the item, revealing…

"A book?" Pinkie asks in disbelief and looks at the crusaders, their faces just as puzzled as hers.

"Well, let's see what it has to offer." Pinkie sets the small marked black tome in her lap and opens it up. She blows the sand off the page and begins to read aloud…

The sun shines through a slightly overcast sky on all the happy ponies playing at the beach, a cool breeze accentuating the waves as they crash in. A lone pony, Pinkie Pie, sits at the far side and plunges her orange plastic shovel into the sand, humming a tune with a smile. 

_I hope I find lots of treasure_, she thinks.
