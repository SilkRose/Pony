# X Marks the Plot

Pinkie digs in the sand before her, using her orange plastic shovel, searching for buried treasure.

After she moves a few shovels of sand, she sees something, experiences déjà vu.

"What's this, and why does it feel so familiar?" Pinkie asks as she clears away more sand around the newly found item.

She clears more of the sand, revealing a small brown tome with a red *X* on the cover.

She picks up the book and sets it in her hooves. "This looks old."

Pinkie flips through more pages, each one the same map as the last.

"What's going on here?" she asks.

Pinkie stands up and orients herself with the map.

She trots with the book, following the map with an uneasy feeling.

She slows down as she gets to the more intricate parts of the map, passing over another pony's sand castle in the process.

She gets to a part where the path splits. "This feels familiar?"

Pinkie trots her way thought the left path, climbing over some sleeping ponies in her way.

She gets to the spot. "X marks the spot, let's see what the treasure is," Pinkie says flatly as she begins to dig.

She digs it all up, pulling out…

"Another book, I've seen this book before…"

Pinkie opens the book and begins reading.

Pinkie digs in the sand using her blue plastic shovel.

She digs fast, uncovering what she already knows is there.

"Found it," Pinkie says as she uncovers the forgotten tome.

She clears more of the sand, revealing the book she already knew about.

She picks up the book. "Why?"

"There is a map in here, on every page," Pinkie says before flipping through the book, revealing what she said to be true.

"Why is it repeating?" she asks before following the map.

She seamlessly passes over all obstacles like she's been here before.

She gets to a part where the path splits. "Let's go right."

Pinkie takes the left path.

She gets to the spot. "X marks the spot," Pinkie says as she begins to dig.

She digs it all up, pulling out the same book…

"I've read this book before…"

Pinkie opens the book and begins reading.

Pinkie digs in the sand before her, using her purple plastic shovel.

She finds a book.

"Don't open it!"

Pinkie opens the book, finding a map.

"Stop making me do this, over and over."

Pinkie follows the map, unquestionably and without concern.

"I have so many questions and many concerns, actually."

Pinkie effortlessly navigates the map, not stopping or getting distracted along the way.

"Let me out of this loop!"

Pinkie finds the *X* and begins to dig. She finds a book.

"Don't read it!"

Pinkie begins to read it.

"Wait, I have only eleven words to say! Please, just stop–"
