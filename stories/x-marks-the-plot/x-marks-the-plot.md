# X Marks the Plot

The sun shines brightly down on all the happy ponies playing at the beach, a cool breeze accentuating the waves as they crash in. A lone pony, Pinkie Pie, sits at the far side, toiling to herself in the sand.

Pinkie plunges her yellow plastic shovel into the sand as the tide tickles her left flank with an elongated wave. She giggles as she scoops shovel after shovel of sand. *I hope I find lots of treasure,* she thinks.

Pinkie shovels more sand as she quietly hums to herself, a big smile plastering her face. As the hole gets deeper and deeper, she begins to worry. *Maybe this spot isn't a good one.* But as soon as she finishes her thought, the shovel hits something in the sand.

"OOO, I found something!" Pinkie shouts ecstatically, shoveling faster. She uncovers a small black tome with a red X on the cover. She carefully picks it up and places it in her lap.

Pinkie opens the book to the first page. Finding a map, she gets excited. "A treasure map!" Pinkie squeals in delight as her mind races. *What does it lead to? Bits, gems, candy? Or maybe cotton candy?*

Pinkie's eyes light up at the thought of discovering a candy-based treasure. "I must find it," Pinkie mutters, determined. She stands up and orients herself with the map in the book before setting out on her grand adventure for the treasure to be found.

She starts following the map closely, executing each turn with precision and determination. Pinkie sticks to the dotted line on the map, eyes darting back and forth between the map and her surroundings.

As she walks by two pegasi and an earth pony drawing in the sand, she compliments their work, a grand drawing of Celestia raising the sun. "Nice job, looks great!" Pinkie exclaims.

Pinkie turns the corner and runs right into a volley-ball game. The players all stop and look at her expectantly. *I guess it won't hurt to play one game,* Pinkie thinks, before choosing a side.

Pinkie gets into position and serves the ball on her side. She plays with determination and a smile on her face. She serves her team to victory, taking them from eleven points to twenty-five.

Pinkie celebrates joyously with her team before congratulating the other team on a game well played. She trots off the court and continues her quest, back on track.
