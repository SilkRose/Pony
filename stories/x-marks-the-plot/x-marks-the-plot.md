# X Marks the Plot

The sun shines brightly down on all the happy ponies playing at the beach, a cool breeze accentuating the waves as they crash in. A lone pony, Pinkie Pie, sits at the far side.

Pinkie plunges her yellow plastic shovel into the sand, humming a tune with a smile. *I hope I find lots of treasure*, she thinks.

As she digs, the tide tickles her left flank with an elongated wave. She giggles before continuing to dig.

As the hole gets deeper and deeper, she begins to worry. *Maybe this spot isn't a good one*. But as soon as she finishes her thought, the shovel hits something in the sand.

"OOO, I found something!" Pinkie shouts ecstatically, shoveling faster. She uncovers a small black tome with a red X on the cover. She carefully picks it up and places it in her lap, then blows the sand off it.

She opens the book to the first page. Finding a map, she gets excited. "A treasure map!" she squeals in delight as her mind races. What does it lead to? Bits, gems, candy? Or maybe cotton candy?

Pinkie's eyes light up at the thought of discovering a candy-based treasure. "I must find it," Pinkie mutters, determined.

She stands up and orients herself with the map in the book before setting out on her grand adventure.

She starts following the map closely, eyes darting back and forth between the dotted line on the map and her surroundings.

She walks by two pegasi and an earth pony, drawing a grand depiction of Celestia raising the sun. "Nice job, looks great!" She compliments.

Pinkie turns the corner and runs right into a volley-ball game.

Looking up from her map, she sees the ball heading straight for her. Thinking quickly, she punts the ball, and it soars to the other side of the court, scoring a point for the side she trotted into.

Her side congratulates her, and she takes a bow before trotting off the other side of the court.

She continues her march forward, determined not to get distracted again. I've got to find that treasure, she thinks.

She looks near the edge of the beach, where the Cutie Mark Crusaders are busy building a sand castle.

Sweetie Belle takes notice and glances up at her curiously.

"Hi, Pinkie Pie, what are you doing?" Sweetie Belle asks Pinkie.

"I'm looking for buried treasure!" Pinkie explains, waving the map.

"Oh, can we come with you, please?" Sweetie Belle pleads in excitement.

"Sure!" Pinkie proclaims.

The trio follows behind Pinkie as she leads them down the dotted line. They all stop as the path splits before them. They hold a vote and the winning side is left.

They go down the left path, running into a long line of sleeping ponies. Pinkie looks at the map, then back at the ponies.

"The line is right where they're sleeping, we have to go over," Pinkie says before she hops over each of the sleeping ponies one at a time. The Cutie Mark Crusaders follow behind her, doing the same.

The path rejoins as they get close to the water. Pinkie leads them slightly into the water, where she sighs in relief as the cool water works wonders for her, which she notices only now, hot hooves. Pinkie prances along the path in the water, enjoying the water splashing her.

The Cutie Mark Crusaders follow behind her, splashing each other and giggling happily as they go.

They turn back to land and make their final turn. Trotting forward some distance, they reach the X on the map. Barely able to contain her excitement, Pinkie shouts, "We're here!"

Pinkie sits down and is about to start digging when the Cutie Mark Crusaders beat her to it, the three fillies digging wildly in the sand with their hooves. Pinkie joins in, digging with her shovel as she giggles excitedly.

"This is so exciting!" Scootaloo says.

"I know, right!" Sweetie Belle comments.

"I can't wait to see what it is," Apple Bloom says.

Pinkie digs with glee in anticipation of what kind of treasure it could be, but before she can finish her mental list, her shovel stops in its track, hitting something in the sand. "We found it!" Pinkie shouts, clearing more sand around the item.

Pinkie clears the item, revealing…

"A book?" Pinkie asks in disbelief.

Pinkie looks at the crusaders, their faces just as puzzled as hers.

She looks on the bright side, trying to bring their spirits back up. "Well, let's see what it has to offer." Pinkie sets the small marked black tome in her lap and opens it up. She blows the sand off the page and begins to read aloud…
