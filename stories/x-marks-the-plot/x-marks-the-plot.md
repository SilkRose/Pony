# X Marks the Plot

Pinkie digs in the sand before her, using her blue plastic shovel, searching for buried treasure.

After she moves a few shovels of sand, she sees something.

"What's this," Pinkie asks excitedly as she clears away more sand around the newly found item.

She clears more of the sand, revealing a small brown tome with a red *X* on the cover.

She picks up the book and sets it in her hooves. "This looks old."

She opens it up, revealing a map. "A map," she says excitedly.

Pinkie stands up and orients herself with the map.

She bounces with the book, following the map with a smile plastered on her face.

She slows down as she gets to the more intricate parts of the map, passing over another pony's sand castle in the process.

She gets to a part where the path splits. "I can go either way?"

Pinkie bounces her way thought the left path, climbing over some sleeping ponies in her way.

She gets to the spot. "X marks the spot, let's see what the treasure is," Pinkie says excitedly as she furiously begins to dig.

She digs it all up, pulling out…

"Another book?"

Pinkie opens the book and begins reading.

Pinkie digs in the sand using her red plastic shovel.

She hits something in the sand as she experiences déjà vu.

"What's this," Pinkie asks as she uncovers the forgotten tome.

She clears more of the sand, revealing a small black tome with a red *X* on the cover.

She picks up the book. "This looks old."

She opens it up, revealing…

"A map," she says quizzically.

Pinkie flips through more pages, each one the same map as the last.

"What's going on here?" she asks before following the map.

She seamlessly passes over all obstacles like she's been here before.

She gets to a part where the path splits. "This feels familiar?"

Pinkie takes the same path she swore she's taken before.

She gets to the spot. "X marks the spot," Pinkie says as she begins to dig.

She digs it all up, pulling out…

"I've seen this book before…"

Pinkie opens the book and begins reading.

Pinkie digs in the sand before her, using her purple plastic shovel.

She finds a book.

"Don't open it!"

Pinkie opens the book, finding a map.

"Stop making me do this, over and over."

Pinkie follows the map, unquestionably and without concern.

"I have so many questions and many concerns, actually."

Pinkie effortlessly navigates the map, not stopping or getting distracted along the way.

"Let me out of this loop!"

Pinkie finds the *X* and begins to dig. She finds a book.

"Don't read it!"

Pinkie begins to read it.

"Wait, I have only eleven words to say! Please, just stop–"
