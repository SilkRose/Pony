# X Marks the Plot

Pinkie digs in the sand before her, using her blue plastic shovel, searching for buried treasure.

After she moves a few shovels of sand, she sees something.

"What's this," Pinkie asks excitedly as she clears away more sand around the newly found item.

She clears more of the sand, revealing a small brown tome with a red *X* on the cover.

She picks up the book and sets it in her hooves. "This looks old."

She opens it up, revealing a map. "A map," she says excitedly.

Pinkie stands up and orients herself with the map.

She bounces with the book, following the map with a smile plastered on her face.

She slows down as she gets to the more intricate parts of the map, passing over another pony's sand castle in the process.

She gets to a part where the path splits. "I can go either way?"

Pinkie bounces her way thought the left path, climbing over some sleeping ponies in her way.

She gets to the spot. "X marks the spot, let's see what the treasure is," Pinkie says excitedly as she furiously begins to dig.

She digs it all up, pulling outâ€¦

"Another book?"

Pinkie opens the book and begins reading.
