## Short Description:


## Ideas:
- Animated cover in the long description on FIMFiction.
- Each chapter will have at least one image, probably animated.
- Mess with formatting, including using images for text.
- The story has two acts, one of Twilight helping Pinkie with the book, and one of them switching bodies.
- As Twilight helps with the Book of Pink, she grows closer to Pinkie.
- "As I stated in my next chapterâ€¦"
- The poetry chapter will have limericks that change inside an image.
- Twilight will be fascinated with the changing text, wanting to know how she does it.
- Pinkie teaches this in a later chapter.
- When they switch bodies, do they switch cutie marks?
