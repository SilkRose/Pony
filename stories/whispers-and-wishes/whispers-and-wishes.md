# Whispers and Wishes

I stare blankly into the darkness of Pinkie's ceiling above me, mind wandering as I can't sleep. Around me all my friends are asleep, but I continue to lay awake, and continue to think of *her*.

I hear a rustle and try to look to see if anyone had awoken, but seeing nothing, I lay my head back down.

I sigh, closing my eyes and resolve to get some sleep.

I whisper to her, "Goodnight, Pinkie…"

"Fluttershy?"

My eyes shoot open, "Pinkie?"

"Can't sleep?"

I gently move my hand, trying to find hers. "No, I can't stop thinking."

"Oh, about what?"

I find her hand and hold it. "About what I wish for…"

Pinkie holds my hand in return. "OOO, what do you wish for? I'll tell you what I wish for if you tell me yours!"

"Deal. Can you go first?"

"Sure. I wish for your wish to come true! And for all my friends to be happy!"

I try to speak, but don't know what to say. All that comes out in a squeak.

"Are you alright? You're squeezing my hand a lot all of a sudden."

"I… I'm… I'm sorry."

"It's okay. We can talk about something else."

"Like what?"

"Did you enjoy the sleepover so far?"

"Yes, I had a lot of fun, but I can't stop thinking about…"

"Am I helping by holding your hand?"

"Yes."

*She's squeezing my hand, what do I do?*

"Thank you…"

"You're welcome!"

The room goes unusually quiet as I can hear my heart beating in my chest.

*What do I say? Can she hear my rapid heartbeat?*

Pinkie says in a gentle tone, "This is nice."

I don't answer, paralyzed by my anxieties.

I squeeze her hand a bit tighter and calm down.

I eventually say, "Yes."

Pinkie squeezes back. "I know I'm not the most serious of people usually, but I'm always here for you if you need anything."

I could hear the genuine smile radiating from her statement.

*Oh, what I have I done? What should I say?*

"Thank you… thank you."

We just lay there in silence, eventually I get comfortable enough and start playing little hand games with her. The room stays silent, with the occasional outburst of muffled giggles coming mostly from Pinkie Pie.

I stop fiddling around as I feel her scooting closer.

I wait a minute before asking, "Do you ever feel lonely?"

"I think everybody does sometimes. Is that why you held my hand?"

"Kinda…"

"I'm glad you did, it kept me from being lonely too."

"Do you ever feel a connection to someone you can't explain?"

"Hmm, yes, actually."

"That's why I couldn't sleep because I was thinking about… you…"

I can feel the blush forming on my face as I wait for her reply.

"That's very nice of you."

I giggle slightly. "Pinkie…"

"What?"

I sigh and squeeze her hand. "I… *like* you."

"Oh."

"I've wanted to tell you for a while," I whisper, my voice softening. "But I've been too shy…"

She squeezes my hand. "Well, you told me now, and that's great!"

I say, with hope in my heart and voice, "Does that mean… you like me?"

"Earlier, before we started talking, I had a Pinkie Sense, and it told me that someone was going to hold my hand tonight. I didn't know what to think of it, I thought something bad might happen! And, I noticed before all that, that you were acting differently around me, and I was sorta acting differently around you too. In a differently-er kinda way. I didn't know what it meant, but when I saw you couldn't sleep, I realized it was you who I was going to hold hands with. And it made me happy! Like super-duper happy! I knew that it could only mean one thing, especially when you asked about being lonely and having a connection to someone."

I hesitantly ask, "What was that?"

Pinkie shouts at a whisper's volume, "That I *like* you too!"

"You do?!"

"Yes!"

"Yay!"

My heart flutters as the realization of the situation hits me.

*Pinkie and I like each other!*

"Fluttershy?"

"Yes?"

"Will you go out with me?"

I squeeze her hand and smile wide. "Yes!"

"Yay!"

We go silent and after a few moments of taking in the moment, I yawn.

Pinkie speaks up, "We should probably get some sleep. We have a lot of dating to do tomorrow."

"Sounds fun, but… can we hold hands while we fall asleep?"

"Absolutely," Pinkie says with enthusiasm.

I giggle. "Goodnight, Pinkie."

She squeezes my hand. "Goodnight, Fluttershy."
