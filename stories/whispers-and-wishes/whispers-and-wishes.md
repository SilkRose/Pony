"Pinkie?"

"Fluttershy?"

"Can we hold hands? If that's alright…"

"Yes, can't sleep?"

*Her hand is so soft.*

"No, I can't stop thinking."

"Oh, about what?"

"About what I wish for…"

"OOO, what do you wish for? I'll tell you what I wish for if you tell me yours!"

"Deal. Can you go first?"

"Sure. I wish for your wish to come true! And for all my friends to be happy!"

"…"

"Are you alright? You're squeezing my hand a lot all of a sudden."

"I'm… I'm… sorry."

"It's okay. We can talk about something else."

"Like what?"

"Did you enjoy the sleepover so far?"

"Yes, but I can't stop thinking about…"

"Am I helping by holding your hand?"

"Yes."

*She squeezed my hand, what do I do?*
