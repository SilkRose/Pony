# Whispers and Wishes

I stare blankly into the darkness of Pinkie's ceiling above. My mind wanders. My friends are asleep all around me, but I continue to lay awake, and continue to think of *her*.

I hear a rustle and try to look to see if anyone had awoken, but don't see anything. I lay my head back down.

I sigh, closing my eyes and resolve to get some sleep.

I whisper to her, "Goodnight, Pinkie…"

Pinkie speaks up. "Fluttershy?"

My eyes shoot open. "Pinkie?"

Pinkie asks with a concerned tone, "Can't sleep?"

I gently move my hand, trying to find hers. "No, I can't stop thinking."

"Oh, about what?"

*About you.*

I find her hand and hold it. "About what I wish for…"

Pinkie holds my hand in return. "Ooh, what do you wish for? I'll tell you my wish if you tell me yours!"

I hesitate for a moment, but relent. "Deal… but can you go first?"

"Sure. I wish for your wish to come true! And for all my friends to be happy!"

I try to speak, but don't know what to say. All that comes out in a squeak.

Pinkie asks, worried, "Are you alright? You're squeezing my hand a lot all of a sudden."

I falter. "I… I'm… I'm sorry."

Her voice softens. "It's okay. We can talk about something else."

"Like what?"

Pinkie asks with optimism, "Are you enjoying the sleepover so far?"

"Yes, I had a lot of fun, but I couldn't stop thinking about…"

"Am I helping by holding your hand?"

"Yes."

*She's squeezing my hand, what do I do?*

"Thank you…"

"You're welcome!"

The room goes unusually quiet as I can hear my heart beating in my chest.

*What do I say? Can she hear my rapid heartbeat?*

Pinkie says in a gentle tone, "This is nice."

I don't answer, paralyzed by my anxieties.

I squeeze her hand a bit tighter and calm down.

I eventually say, "Yes."

Pinkie squeezes back. "I know I'm not the most serious of people usually, but I'm always here for you if you need anything."

I don't need to look at her to see her genuine smile. I can hear it.

*Oh, what I have I done? What should I say?*

"Thank you… thank you."

We just lie there in silence. Eventually I get comfortable enough and start playing little hand games with her. The room stays silent, except for the occasional outburst of muffled giggles coming mostly from Pinkie Pie.

I stop fiddling around as I feel her scooting closer.

I wait a minute before asking, "Do you ever feel lonely?"

"I think everybody does sometimes. Is that why you held my hand?"

"Kinda… I've been feeling different lately, and I don't know what to do…"

"I'm glad you held my hand, it kept me from being lonely, too. Maybe I can help you somehow?"

"Do you ever feel a connection to someone you can't explain?"

"Hmm, yes, actually."

"That's why I couldn't sleep because I was thinking about… you… I feel different around you… and I didn't understand why for the longest time. I really like being around you, a lot."

I can feel the blush forming on my face as I wait for her reply.

"That's very nice of you to think of me. I love thinking about my friends."

I giggle slightly. "Pinkie…"

"What?"

I sigh and squeeze her hand. "I… *like* you."

"Oh."

"I've wanted to tell you for a while," I whisper, my voice softening. "But I've been too shy…"

She squeezes my hand. "Well, you told me now, and that's great!"

I say, with hope in my heart and voice, "Does that mean… you like me?"

Pinkie speaks in a quiet but rushed voice, "Earlier, before we started talking, I felt my Pinkie Sense, and it told me that someone was going to hold my hand tonight. I didn't know what to think of it, I thought something bad might happen! And I noticed, before all that, that you were acting differently around me, and I was sorta acting differently around you too. In a differently-er kinda way. I didn't know what it meant, but when I saw you couldn't sleep, I realized it was you who I was going to hold hands with. And it made me happy! Like super-duper happy! I knew that it could only mean one thing, especially when you asked about being lonely and having a connection to someone."

I hesitantly ask, "What did it mean?"

Pinkie shouts at a whisper's volume, "That *I* like you too!"

"You do?!"

"Yes!"

"Yay!"

My heart flutters as the reality of the situation hits me.

*Pinkie Pie likes me back!*

"Fluttershy?"

"Yes?"

"Will you go out with me?"

I squeeze her hand and smile wide. "Yes!"

"Yay!"

We go silent and after a few moments of taking in this moment, Pinkie asks, "Was that your wish?"

"Yes, I really like you and wanted to date you."

"I'm glad I could make your wish a reality. And I'm glad I discovered I had the same wish as you!"

"Thank you, I'm glad too."

I see Pinkie's silhouette rise up, and she uses my hand to pull me up with her.

Moments later, I'm wrapped in a tight Pinkie Pie hug. I return the hug and sink into it.

I hear her squee as I tighten my hold on her.

A few tears escape my eyes as we linger in the loving embrace.

We let go after a bit and stared at each other with big smiles on our faces.

I yawn and Pinkie follows suit.

Pinkie speaks up, "We should probably get some sleep. We have a lot of dating to do tomorrow."

We lay back down, not holding hands anymore.

I speak up and ask, "Sounds fun, but… can we hold hands while we fall asleep?"

"Absolutely," Pinkie says with enthusiasm.

Pinkie grabs my hand and holds it gently.

I giggle. "Goodnight, Pinkie."

She squeezes my hand. "Goodnight, Fluttershy."

All our friends say in unison, "Goodnight Pinkie, goodnight Fluttershy."
