# Whispers and Wishes

I stare blankly into the darkness of Pinkie's ceiling above me, mind wandering as I can't sleep. Around me all my friends are asleep, but I continue to lay awake, and continue to think of *her*.

I sigh, closing my eyes and resolve to get some sleep.

I whisper to her, "Goodnight, Pinkie…"

"Fluttershy?"

My eyes shoot open, "Pinkie?"

"Can't sleep?"

I gently move my hand, trying to find hers. "No, I can't stop thinking."

"Oh, about what?"

I find her hand and hold it. "About what I wish for…"

Pinkie holds my hand in return. "OOO, what do you wish for? I'll tell you what I wish for if you tell me yours!"

"Deal. Can you go first?"

"Sure. I wish for your wish to come true! And for all my friends to be happy!"

I try to speak, but don't know what to say. All that comes out in a squeak.

"Are you alright? You're squeezing my hand a lot all of a sudden."

"I… I'm… I'm sorry."

"It's okay. We can talk about something else."

"Like what?"

"Did you enjoy the sleepover so far?"

"Yes, I had a lot of fun, but I can't stop thinking about…"

"Am I helping by holding your hand?"

"Yes."

*She's squeezing my hand, what do I do?*

"Thank you…"

"You're welcome!"

The room goes unusually quiet as I can hear my heart beating in my chest.

*What do I say? Can she hear my rapid heartbeat?*

Pinkie says in a gentle tone, "This is nice."

I don't answer, paralyzed by my anxieties.

I squeeze her hand a bit tighter and calm down.

I eventually say, "Yes."

Pinkie squeezes back. "I know I'm not the most serious of people usually, but I'm always here for you if you need anything."

I could hear the genuine smile radiating from her statement.

*Oh, what I have I done? What should I say?*

"Thank you… thank you."

We just lay there in silence, eventually I get comfortable enough and start playing little hand games with her. The room stays silent, with the occasional outburst of muffled giggles coming from mostly Pinkie Pie.

I stop fiddling around as I feel her scooting closer.

I wait a minute before asking, "Do you ever feel lonely?"

"I think everybody does sometimes. Is that why you held my hand?"

"Kinda…"

"I'm glad you did."

"Do you ever feel a connection to someone you can't explain?"

"Hmm, yes, actually."

"That's why I couldn't sleep because I was thinking about… you…"

I can feel the blush forming on my face as I wait for her reply.

"That's very nice of you."

I giggle slightly. "Pinkie…"

"What?"

I sigh and squeeze her hand. "I… *like* you."

"Oh."
