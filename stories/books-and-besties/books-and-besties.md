# Books and Besties

I close Twilight's door as the rain pounds the bark of her tree house.

Twilight asks, "Do you want to stay here tonight, Pinkie?"

Thunder roars in the distance as my answer is made for me.

"Yes, this is going to be so much fun!"

"Oh, I'm so excited! What should we do, read a book? I've been reading a lot of stories about romance lately."

Twilight doesn't wait for my reply, instead she starts getting books down from the shelves, funneling them to me.

As she levitates books at me, I notice a book with an old-timey castle on the front of it. I get inspired and build the castle out of the books Twilight is floating me.

Eventually she turns back to me and notices the castle, causing her mouth to hand open in shock. "Didn't think I got down that many books…"

I lower the functioning book drawbridge. "It's okay, come on in!"

She comes inside and I give her a hug.

She returns the hug. "Nice job on the castle."

"Thanks, but instead of reading a story, we could make our own! We've got so many books we can make anything we want out of them."

"What story should we tell, though?"

"It could be anything. What story do you want to tell?"

Twilight's ears fold back, and she looks down at the floor for a second before looking back up at me. "Could we go on a date? Like a fake one… I've never been on a date."

"Absolutely! That sounds fun."

Twilight hugs me tightly. "Thanks."

"You're welcome."

After the hug, Twilight asks, "What do we do first on our date?"

As I think about how dates work, something immediately sticks out in my head. "Let's go on a romantic walk at the beach."

"How do we do that with just a pile of books?"

"We use our imagination. We can use books with colors like sand and water."

"Oh, okay."

"Can you get me the books we can use for sand?"

"Sure," Twilight says before exiting the castle.

I follow her and wait for the books to be funneled my way.

As the books comes my way, I pile them up around the castle, forming a circle around it, with the books stacked higher near the castle.

Twilight gives me the last book and turns to me. "Wow, that's a surprisingly good beach."

"Thank you. Do you wanna make the ocean?"

"I can try."

Twilight levitates down a lot of blue books before staring at the beach I had made.

Eventually she starts placing the ocean. She blankets the entire floor with the books, leaving a small ring around the beach book free for us to walk in.

She looks at me and asks, "How did I do?"

"You did amazing!"

Twilight blushes and asks, "You ready for our romantic walk on the beach?"
