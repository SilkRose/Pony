# Calling Ponies Cute

## Synopsis:
A formulaic story concept with highly restricted chapter scope. "You" call various ponies cute, and they react to it. However, things take a turn when it's revealed "You" are actually trapped in some kind of curse, forced to call every pony you can think of cute. Twilight and the gang have to figure out a way to keep you in one place long enough to cast a spell.

## Ideas:
- Short chapters to start with. Ideally fixed length. <=150 words
- Every chapter (until the end) MUST start with the quoted sentence "Hi {pony}. You're cute!", and MUST end once the reaction to being called cute is over.
- You are moved to the next pony's location instantaneously once the prior pony's reaction ends. Sentences started in one chapter may be continued in the next if these locations are very similar.
- Not all ponies being called cute can be included in the story. So, we can assume, if time passes between chapters, ponies are being called cute between these chapters as well.
- Twilight is the first pony. After a number of other ponies are called cute, Spike is the next "pony", and Twilight is talking to him about You. The timing of Spike is less important but it should be fairly soon.
- Later mane 6 chapters, esp. Pinkie Pie and Rarity, can be significantly longer than usual to accommodate longer reactions and more narrative progress. Applejack's chapter might be extended by sequencing her family's chapters right after hers.
- The next pony who gets called cute depends on the next pony You think of when the reaction ends. So it can be controlled, intentionally or unintentionally.
- You can only react to a pony whose name you know. If you can't think of any names, you are displaced to abstract space until you can think of a name.
