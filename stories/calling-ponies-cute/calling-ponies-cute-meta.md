# Calling Ponies Cute

## Synopsis:
A formulaic story concept with highly restricted chapter scope. "You" call various ponies cute, and they react to it. However, things take a turn when it's revealed "You" are actually trapped in some kind of curse, forced to call every pony you can think of cute. Twilight and the gang have to figure out a way to keep you in one place long enough to cast a spell.
