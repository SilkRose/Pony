# Matchbox Ponies

"Sweetest pie," she muttered, "where's Pinkie?"

"My friends, see how they glisten…"

Celestia surrendered the castle at Canterlot.

Twilight Sparkle dies, Pinkie Pie lies.

"For greater good," said Harmony's Apostles.

Rarity knew Pinkie, softer than Fluttershy.

Twilight Sparkle's mind fell into pieces.

When pushed, Twilight overcame her fear.

Celestia looks out upon the ashes.

Fluttershy nursed Rainbow back to health.

Applejack ran as the barn burned.

The ground shakes around Canterlot Castle.

Luna glared as Celestia walked away.

Luna's moon is closer than normal.

Rainbow never forgot Scootaloo's hopeful smile.

The painting winked, hoof against lips.

Twilight will talk, Pinkie had listened.

Applejack hugged Rarity, Rarity kissed Applejack.

Twilight reached for Rainbow too late.

Twilight's castle was darker than usual.

Scootaloo lost her scooter one night.

The dust on Twilight's books stagnated.

Twilight marries Rarity, after removing competition.

Twilight finds brick, in her shower.

Scootaloo's wings grew much bigger overnight.

Rarity convinces Rainbow to kiss Pinkie.

Equestria. Where every day is Sunday.

Pinkie kissed Twilight every single day.

Fluttershy stared into Rarity's unbridled soul.

Ponies riding ponies? Oh, the equinity!

"Pinkie, shut up and kiss me."

Rainbow showed Twilight how to preen.

Rainbow lied, right before catching fire.

"More cider!" She never had enough.

The flowers wilted in Fluttershy's garden.

"Hooves off my daughter!" Velvet demanded.

Pinkie won it, Rainbow's first kiss.

Pinkie's first kiss was her last.

Rainbow taped her own mouth shut.

Words 'pony' and 'miracle' are synonymous.

Her books, all burnt and ashen.

The moon was red that night.

"Believe!" cried Rainbow, letting Scootaloo go.

Rainbow stole all of Twilight's quills.

Pinkie booped, Pinkie hugged, Pinkie kissed.

Twilight kissed Rainbow's neck, Rainbow blushed.

Twilight Sparkle loved her more, forever.

The Cutie Map began showing side-quests.

"No more school," she observed Ponyville.

Rainbow was the first to die.

The sun is rising too early.

"Every color!" Pinkie giggled, smearing brush.

Fluttershy never got to say goodbye.

Ponies panicked when Celestia's sun disappeared.

The lightning missed Rainbow just barely.

Friendship did not save them all.

Twilight could no longer feel magic.

Pinkie nibbled lovingly on Rainbow's ear.

Rainbow finished doing Fluttershy's last chore.

Scootaloo got the best sister ever.

"Luna, bring me the pesticide, quickly."

"Sleep paralysis demon? You mean Chuck?"

Rainbow hit the wall too hard.

Rainbow taught Twilight to cloud nap.

When awoken, Rainbow kissed Fluttershy pink.

Cyan feathers fell from the sky.

A staircase opened under Twilight's floor.

My coat began changing color today.

Twilight died not knowing of mares.

Twilight said what Celestia never did.

They stopped to wave at foals.

"I love you," Twilight Sparkle lied.

Sweetie's song stunned, and killed them.

Rarity loved Pinkie and Fluttershy, romantically.

The Everfree went quiet one day.

Balloons flew upwards from her flank.

Pinkie wanted to kiss Rarity, forever.

Pinkie was the softest of pillows.

"Luna, you're obviously adopted." "No, you."

Fluttershy forgot Rainbow after she left.

Scootaloo admired Rainbow's wingless sleeping form.

Pinkie's smile melted my heart, daily.

Lyra and Bonbon lost their rings.

Rainbow smiled softly as she wept.

Soon, a new constellation lit up.

Rainbow Dash lost her fan club.

Scootaloo stared longingly at the clouds.

Rainbow falls flat, Pinkie inflates her.

A harmonious hum rang between them.

Rarity never forgot Fluttershy's pretty face.

Twilight failed for the last time.

Over time, Shining Armor became Dirty.

Pinkie never forgot, until one day.

Fluttershy was the most dangerous here.

Twilight's library is bereft of books.

Scootaloo smiled at Rainbow and cried.

Harmony ended when they invented internet.

Discord molded them into a bouquet.

Pinkie retired with love around her.

Pinkie ponders, Twilight thinks, Rarity revolts.

Her long horn was firmly grasped.

Luna doesn't visit my dreams anymore.

Pinkie never got old to Rarity.

She looked up. The rainbow soared.

The awesome part is, Rainbow's cuteness.

Pinkie Pie loved her first-ever kiss.

Her name terrified all: FLURRY HEART.

Luna refused to lower the moon.

From her snake tongue slithered lies.

Rarity kissed Pinkie. Twilight never knew.

While watching *her*, Fluttershy couldn't think.

Her heart spoke in forgotten languages.

We outlawed eating grass in 507.

Rainbow wept on the turtle shell.

Pinkie blushed every time they kissed.

The sun shone on nopony today.

Applejack's bucks have gotten weaker lately.

Rainbow hugged Tank one last time.

Rainbow's feathers began to fall off.

Sunset never came back to Equestria.

Discord cackled. All went in accord.

"Canterlot!" "It's only a model." "Shhh!"

Starlight gazed regrettably at her mark.

"Oops…" Trixie told the manticore dung.

Pinkie sensed a doozy coming soon.

My friends are always with me.

"Marry me?" Pinkie asked, Twilight faltered.

Scootaloo never forgot Rainbow's impact sound.

In reflection, Fluttershy saw an animal.

Apples aren't selling like they did.

Twilight keeps backups of her friends.

Sweetie Belle loved her sister again.

Applejack couldn't move after the fall.

Rarity loved every Twilight Sparkle embrace.

Suddenly, the Moon began to descend.

"You," Twilight said before kissing Pinkie.

Rarity lies that Sweetie isn't hers.

Pinkie melted as Rarity massaged her.

Rainbow flew apart. Others soon followed.

One day, Applejack gave up apples.

Pinkie's party had only one guest.

Pinkie cuddles Rarity with fierce determinism.

Pinkie laughed joyously at her will.

"Luna, your Nightmare Moon is showing."

Pinkie kisses Twilight, Twilight studies it.

Rainbow's mane lost all its color.

The river near Ponyville turned black.

Twilight never knew about this feeling.

Pinkie licks Twilight on the cheek.

The start. the middle. The end.

Applejack won the war for Equestria.

Sunset froze. Celestia broke the mirror.

"No!" Fluttershy screamed in vain, falling.

Twilight couldn't handle losing her friends.

Celestia cried at the occupied moon.

The pillow moistened under Pinkie's head.

The fire lit. The darkness remained.

Rarity never forgot their anniversary again.

Fluttershy never saw Angel ever again.

Rainbow just barely clipped the ring.

Pinkie loved Rarity, even as ashes.

The adorableness increased when Fluttershy entered.

Twilight loved the smell of Pinkie.

Twilight lost hope, Rarity found love.

Rarity blushed, kissing Fluttershy's cutie mark.

Even Luna's moon cannot be seen.

Fake hoof concealed a tiny hand.

Pinkie cried invisibly watching her funeral.

Luna made the stars shine brightly.

Without supervision, the apples went bad.

Spike didn't get out in time.

Rainbow cried on Scootaloo's birthday, annually.

Fluttershy really likes Rainbow Dash, romantically.

Fluttershy whimpered as shadows drew closer.

While walking home, Rarity found love.

Rarity shows Pinkie love, Pinkie reciprocates.

"Let's not be horsing around, seriously."

Twilight smiled as her book arrived.

Rarity made her unused wedding dress.

"Rainbow Factory? Pie Factory is worse."

Twilight couldn't read after the incident.

He used their horns as toothpicks.

Twilight wept, surrounded by her friends.

Applejack's heart never saw Rarity coming.

Luna carved her tears in stone.

Her mane went fluttering, then stopped.

Twilight heard Spike cry from below.

Rarity's newest dress incorporated blood stains.

Twilight's bedroom window was now open.

Fluttershy never found Rainbow's remains again.

Nightmare Moon flared in the stratosphere.

Pinkie fell for Rarity, Rarity watched.

Twilight determines her immortality must end.

Pinkie is stuck in the dryer.

Starlight's eyes opened and saw nothing.

Pinkie Pie pranked herself this time.

Fluttershy never opened *that* door, again.

One day, Rainbow started fearing heights.

Twilight spotted smoke in the library.

Pinkie drools on Rarity's chest again.
