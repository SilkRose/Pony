Pinkie's first kiss was her last.

Applejack couldn't move after the fall.

Pinkie will never forget that coffin.

Lyra and Bonbon lost their rings.

Pinkie Pie loved her first-ever kiss.

Twilight's bedroom window was now open.

Pinkie's party had only one guest.

Rainbow's mane lost all its color.

Scootaloo got the best sister ever.

Twilight's library is bereft of books.

Rainbow's first memory was of Fluttershy.

Scootaloo's wings grew much bigger overnight.

Sweetie Belle never learned to play.

Twilight couldn't read after the incident.

Rainbow Dash lost her fan club.

Celestia's sun is hotter than normal.

Luna's moon is closer than normal.

Twilight couldn't handle losing her friends.

Celestia surrendered the castle at Canterlot.

Scootaloo lost her scooter one night.

Luna carved her tears in stone.

Sunset never came back to Equestria.

Fluttershy whimpered as shadows drew closer.

Twilight loved the smell of Pinkie.

Pinkie blushed every time they kissed.

Luna made the stars shine brightly.

Pinkie retired with love around her.

While walking home, Rarity found love.

Without supervision, the apples went bad.

The dust on Twilight's books stagnated.

The sun shone on nopony today.

Rarity loved every Twilight Sparkle embrace.

While watching *her*, Fluttershy couldn't think.

Twilight never knew about this feeling.

Rainbow finished doing Fluttershy's last chore.

Pinkie never got old to Rarity.

Rarity never forgot Fluttershy's pretty face.

When pushed, Twilight overcame her fear.

When awoken, Rainbow kissed Fluttershy pink.

Pinkie loved Rarity, even as ashes.

Twilight said what Celestia never did.

Twilight Sparkle loved her more, forever.

Pinkie never forgot, until one day.

Pinkie cried invisibly watching her funeral.

Rainbow hit the wall too hard.

The stars in the sky screamed.

Fluttershy never opened *that* door, again.

Pinkie is stuck in the dryer.

Fluttershy kissed each friend goodbye, twice.

Pinkie won it, Rainbow's first kiss.

"You," Twilight said before kissing Pinkie.

"No!" Fluttershy screamed in vain, falling.

Pinkie drools on Rarity's chest again.

Twilight kissed Pinkie, who shoves her.

Pinkie ponders, Twilight thinks, Rarity revolts.

Rainbow falls flat, Pinkie inflates her.

Twilight died not knowing of mares.

The flowers wilted in Fluttershy's garden.

Ponies panicked when Celestia's sun disappeared.

Luna doesn't visit my dreams anymore.

One day, Applejack gave up apples.

"I love you," Twilight Sparkle lied.

Pinkie laughed joyously at her will.

Rainbow smiled softly as she wept.

Rainbow wept on the turtle shell.

Rainbow just barely clipped the ring.

Rainbow taped her own mouth shut.

Luna refused to lower the moon.

Apples aren't selling like they did.

Celestia cried at the occupied moon.

Friendship did not save them all.

She looked up. The rainbow soared.

Her mane went fluttering, then stopped.

"Sweetest pie," she muttered, "where's Pinkie?"

Hair moved between his clawed fingers.

Soon, a new constellation lit up.

Her long horn was firmly grasped.

From her snake tongue slithered lies.

Discord cackled. All went in accord.

"More cider!" She never had enough.

"No more school," she observed Ponyville.

The King sat on his throne.

Spell sizzled. The egg didn't hatch.

What, lavender girl? She was bratty.

"Believe!" cried Rainbow, letting Scootaloo go.

Nightmare Moon flared in the stratosphere.

"A phoenix, seriously? Time for testing."

"Is that a blush I see?"

"Pinkie, shut up and kiss me."

Rainbow lied, right before catching fire.

My coat began changing color today.

Twilight Sparkle's mind fell into pieces.

Pinkie was the softest of pillows.

Pinkie's smile melted my heart, daily.

Applejack ran as the barn burned.

Rainbow was the first to die.

Applejack won the war for Equestria.

Twilight's castle was darker than usual.

Pinkie kissed Twilight every single day.

Pinkie sensed a doozy coming soon.

The Everfree went quiet one day.

Rarity blushed, kissing Fluttershy's cutie mark.

Rainbow's feathers began to fall off.

The lightning missed Rainbow just barely.

The moon was red that night.

The sun is rising too early.

Pinkie licks Twilight on the cheek.

Rarity convinces Rainbow to kiss Pinkie.

Fluttershy really likes Rainbow Dash, romantically.

Starlight's eyes opened and saw nothing.

Rarity shows Pinkie love, Pinkie reciprocates.

The awesome part is, Rainbow's cuteness.

The adorableness increased when she entered.

A staircase opened under Twilight's floor.

"Just as planned", Rarity lied unconvincingly.

Fluttershy never got to say goodbye.

Cyan feathers fell from the sky.

Spike farted, Twilight's ashes were sent.

Twilight determines her immortality must end.

Pinkie isn't the first or last.

Twilight keeps backups of her friends.

Rarity lies that Sweetie isn't hers.

Twilight spotted smoke in the library.

Scootaloo admired Rainbow's wingless sleeping form.

Spike didn't get out in time.

Her books, all burnt and ashen.

"Oopsâ€¦" Trixie told the manticore dung.

The ground shakes around Canterlot Castle.

Celestia looks out upon the ashes.

Even Luna's moon cannot be seen.

Sweetie's song stunned, and killed them.

Derpy gets pranked, the CMC chuckle.

Fluttershy never found Rainbow's remains again.

Turns out, the moon eats visitors.

Twilight heard Spike cry from below.

Turns out ponies are great snacks.

The river near Ponyville turned black.

Twilight marries Rarity, after removing competition.

Rarity's newest dress incorporated blood stains.

Rainbow flew apart. Others soon followed.

Rarity kissed Pinkie. Twilight never knew.

Twilight wept, surrounded by her friends.

Rarity kissed Pinkie, then removed her.

Scootaloo smiled at Rainbow and cried.

Rarity knew Pinkie, softer than Fluttershy.

Rarity made her last Applejack dress.

Rarity made her unused wedding dress.

Rainbow hugged Tank one last time.

"Marry me?" Pinkie asked, Twilight faltered.

Pinkie kisses Twilight, Twilight studies it.

Pinkie booped, Pinkie hugged, Pinkie kissed.

Twilight Sparkle dies, Pinkie Pie lies.

Twilight smiled as her book arrived.

Rarity loved Pinkie and Fluttershy, romantically.

Applejack's bucks have gotten weaker lately.

One day, Rainbow started fearing heights.

Fluttershy stared into Rarity's unbridled soul.

Twilight could no longer feel magic.

Pinkie cuddles Rarity with fierce determinism.

Twilight will talk, Pinkie had listened.

Spike put away his last comic.

Luna glared as Celestia walked away.

Pinkie wanted to kiss Rarity, forever.

Pinkie fell for Rarity, Rarity watched.

Pinkie melted as Rarity massaged her.

Scootaloo stared longingly at the clouds.

Rarity loved Applejack's hat, bought two.

Applejack's heart never saw Rarity coming.

Twilight reached for Rainbow too late.

Applejack hugged Rarity, Rarity kissed Applejack.

The pillow moistened under Pinkie's head.

Twilight lost hope, Rarity found love.

Starlight gazed regrettably at her mark.

Twilight finds brick, in her shower.

Pinkie nibbled lovingly on Rainbow's ear.

Twilight kissed Rainbow's neck, Rainbow blushed.

The start. the middle. The end.

Rainbow showed Twilight how to preen.

Rainbow taught Twilight to cloud nap.

Scootaloo never forgot Rainbow's impact sound.

Rainbow never forgot Scootaloo's hopeful smile.
