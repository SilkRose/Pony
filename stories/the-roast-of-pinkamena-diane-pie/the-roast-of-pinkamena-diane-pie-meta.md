## Joke Ideas:

### Twilight:
- If Pinkie stopped eating cake, I think Equestria would lose fifty percent of its Gross Domestic Product sales overnight.
- Pinkie Pie has either never drank coffee in her life, or drinks twelve cups a day, and I'm not sure which is more terrifying.
- I don't think I've ever seen Pinkie sit still for more than five seconds. The first time I saw her asleep, I had to check for a pulse.
- 

### Rarity:
- Pinkie, darling, if your mane were any more unkempt, a bird would start building a nest in it. Oh wait, I think I see one now. Fluttershy, what is it saying?
- I heard that her mane and tail taste like cotton candy, while I have never been brazen enough to try, it at least explains where Gummy gets his nutrition. I don't think I've ever seen her feed him.
- 

### Rainbow:
- Pinkie, I know you have random stashes across Ponyville and Equestria. What I want to know is do you have an insulin stash ready for when the diabetes hits?
- Pinkie, does your Pinkie Sense ever go off at the wrong time? Ever just hanging with your special somepony and get a doozy right as he sets in to hold your hoof.
- 

### Applejack:
- They need to classify you as some kind of weapon, that girl could agitate the apples off a pear tree.
- Pinkie will throw a party for any celebration, and I mean any. If you so much as sneeze wrong, she's liable to throw you a party for it.
- Pinkie will make friends with anypony, I swear. Once I saw her befriending a bush.
- 

### Spike:
- I know we tend to burst into song a lot, but Pinkie takes it to a whole new level. I don't think she's gone a day since I met her without her randomly singing a song about something barely related to what was going on. It's almost like it's a legal requirement. Quick, burst into song if you need help.
