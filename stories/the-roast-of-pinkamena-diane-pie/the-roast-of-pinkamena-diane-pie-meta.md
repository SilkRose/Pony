# The Roast of Pinkamena Diane Pie

## Synopsis:
Pinkie Pie is roasted by her friends and family.

## Description:


## Short Description:


## Ideas:
- Each pony tells three to four jokes about Pinkie, one to two jokes about another attendant, and one to two stories about fun times with Pinkie.
- They tell them in different orders, to make it feel more alive.
- Vary laughs, reactions, and flow to make the story feel natural.
- Twilight goes first, and the next pony is chosen by the speaker.
- Try to make every joke good.
- 


## Joke Ideas:

### Twilight:
- If Pinkie stopped eating cake, I think Equestria would lose fifty percent of its Gross Domestic Product sales overnight.
- Pinkie Pie has either never drank coffee in her life, or drinks twelve cups a day, and I'm not sure which is more terrifying.
- I don't think I've ever seen Pinkie sit still for more than five seconds. The first time I saw her asleep, I had to check for a pulse.
- 

### Rarity:
- Pinkie, darling, if your mane were any more unkempt, a bird would start building a nest in it. Oh wait, I think I see one now. Fluttershy, what is it saying?
- I heard that her mane and tail taste like cotton candy, while I have never been brazen enough to try, it at least explains where Gummy gets his nutrition. I don't think I've ever seen her feed him.
- After making the dresses for the Gala, I'm surprised I haven't had to do any repairs. I would've thought Pinkie would try to eat the fake candy stitched into her dress at least twice by now.
- 

### Rainbow:
- Pinkie, I know you have random stashes across Ponyville and Equestria. What I want to know is do you have an insulin stash ready for when the diabetes hits?
- Pinkie, does your Pinkie Sense ever go off at the wrong time? Ever just hanging with your special somepony and get a doozy right as they set in to hold your hoof.
- Some ponies might say Pinkie is a better fit for the Princess of Friendship, but I have to disagree, she's enough trouble already without wings and a horn.
- 

### Fluttershy:
Each of her jokes is written by a different pony.
- (Angel Bunny): 
- (Spike): 
- (Rainbow): 
- (Twilight): 
- (Rarity): 
- (Applejack): 
- (Pinkie): 

### Applejack:
- They need to classify you as some kind of weapon, that girl could agitate the apples off a pear tree.
- Pinkie will throw a party for any celebration, and I mean any. If you so much as sneeze wrong, she's liable to throw you a party for it.
- Pinkie will make friends with anypony, I swear. Once I saw her befriending a bush. (Pinkie replies, "That bush has a name!")
- 

### Limestone:
- As a filly, Pinkie's mane used to be completely straight. Then, one day, it was all poofy, and she said she had seen a magical rainbow in the sky. We all just assumed she had finally gone crazy. I'm just glad we were wrongâ€¦ We were wrong, right?
- 

### Marble (said aloud by Maud):
- Being Pinkie's twin sister can be hard. Especially when she does all the talking for you. Particularly when she doesn't stop talking ever. Specifically, when she has to ask your crush out for you.
- 

### Spike:
- I know we tend to burst into song a lot, but Pinkie takes it to a whole new level. I don't think she's gone a day since I met her without her randomly singing a song about something barely related to what was going on. It's almost like it's a legal requirement. Quick, burst into song if you need help.
- 

### Starlight:
- "You want to know a secret? Pinkie you have to Pinkie Promise to not get mad if I tell you." Pinkie does the Pinkie Promise. "I broke a Pinkie Promise once." (She winks at Pinkie, and Pinkie starts laughing.)
- 

### Mr. & Mrs. Cake:
- Pinkie, we love you, we just wish you would stop giving all our ice cream to Rarity.
- 

### Scootaloo:
- Pinkie is so bad at Pin the tail on the Pony, I saw her pin it to herself.
- 

### Apple Bloom:
- You're so pink, I couldn't find you in a pig pin.
- 

### Sweetie Belle:
- You'd make a great alarm clock if you had an off button.
- 

### Pinkie's Mirror Pool Clone
- I think we all know why Pinkie is the older twin, she wanted to make new friends, only having Marble for the past 9 months. (Maud after Marble whispers in her ear, "I think we all know why Pinkie is the older twin, Marble pushed her out first so she could enjoy a few minutes of peace and quiet.")
- I heard the Cakes went to everyone else in Equestria before you for child care, even a group of children. I would know because they asked me before you.
- Will the real Pinkie Pie please stand up? Oh wait, I'm already standing!
- Last time I had this many eyes on me, I thought that they had found me. I had to be here, thought, I couldn't turn down the opportunity to make fun of myself without looking in a mirror.
