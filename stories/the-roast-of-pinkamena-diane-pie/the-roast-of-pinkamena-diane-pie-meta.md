## Joke Ideas:

### Twilight:
- If Pinkie stopped eating cake, I think Equestria would lose fifty percent of its Gross Domestic Product sales overnight.
- Pinkie Pie has either never drank coffee in her life, or drinks twelve cups a day, and I'm not sure which is more terrifying.
- I don't think I've ever seen Pinkie sit still for more than five seconds. The first time I saw her asleep, I had to check for a pulse.
- 

### Rarity:
- Pinkie, darling, if your mane were any more unkempt, a bird would start building a nest in it. Oh wait, I think I see one now. Fluttershy, what is it saying?
- I heard that her mane and tail taste like cotton candy, while I have never been brazen enough to try, it at least explains where Gummy gets his nutrition. I don't think I've ever seen her feed him.
- After making the dresses for the Gala, I'm surprised I haven't had to do any repairs. I would've thought Pinkie would try to eat the fake candy stitched into her dress at least twice by now.
- 

### Rainbow:
- Pinkie, I know you have random stashes across Ponyville and Equestria. What I want to know is do you have an insulin stash ready for when the diabetes hits?
- Pinkie, does your Pinkie Sense ever go off at the wrong time? Ever just hanging with your special somepony and get a doozy right as they set in to hold your hoof.
- Some ponies might say Pinkie is a better fit for the Princess of Friendship, but I have to disagree, she's enough trouble already without wings and a horn.
- 

### Fluttershy:
- 

### Applejack:
- They need to classify you as some kind of weapon, that girl could agitate the apples off a pear tree.
- Pinkie will throw a party for any celebration, and I mean any. If you so much as sneeze wrong, she's liable to throw you a party for it.
- Pinkie will make friends with anypony, I swear. Once I saw her befriending a bush. (Pinkie replies, "That bush has a name!")
- 

### Limestone:
- As a filly, Pinkie's mane used to be completely straight. Then, one day, it was all poofy, and she said she had seen a magical rainbow in the sky. We all just assumed she had finally gone crazy. I'm just glad we were wrongâ€¦ We were wrong, right?
- 

### Marble (said aloud by Maud):
- 

### Spike:
- I know we tend to burst into song a lot, but Pinkie takes it to a whole new level. I don't think she's gone a day since I met her without her randomly singing a song about something barely related to what was going on. It's almost like it's a legal requirement. Quick, burst into song if you need help.
- 

### Starlight:
- 

### Mr. & Mrs. Cake:
- Pinkie, we love you, we just wish you would stop giving all our ice cream to Rarity.
- 

### Scootaloo:
- Pinkie is so bad at Pin the tail on the Pony, I saw her pin it to herself.
- 

### Apple Bloom:
- You're so pink, I couldn't find you in a pig pin.
- 

### Sweetie Belle:
- You'd make a great alarm clock if you had an off button.
- 

### Pinkie's Mirror Pool Clone
- I think we all know why Pinkie is the older twin, she wanted to make new friends, only having Marble for the past 9 months. (Maud after Marble whispers in her ear, "I think we all know why Pinkie is the older twin, Marble pushed her out first so she could enjoy a few minutes of peace and quiet.")
- I heard the Cakes went to everyone else in Equestria before you for child care, even a group of children. I would know because they asked me before you.
