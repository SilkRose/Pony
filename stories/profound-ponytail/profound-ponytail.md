# Profound Ponytail

Applejack knocked on Twilight's door, an annoyed expression plastering her face.

Moments later, Twilight opened her door. "Hello."

"Twilight, I need your help, nopony can recognize me!"

"Who are you?" Twilight asked flatly.

"Applejack!"

"But you're not Applejack."

"Of course I am! What difference do you see?"

"Applejack has a blonde ponytail, you don't."

"Applebloom accidentally cut my ponytail off when she was trying to get a barber cutie mark."

"I don't think I've ever seen Applejack without her ponytail."

"I am Applejack, and you have now!"

"Let's say you are Applejack, don't you think I'd recognize you without your ponytail?"

"That's why this is so frustrating. I AM Applejack and nopony believes me!"

"Can you prove that you are Applejack?"

Applejack thinks for a moment before reaching into her saddle bags, giving twilight her cutoff ponytail. "Here, this is my ponytail."

"What do I do with this?"

"I don't know, hold it up so you can see that I'm Applejack."

Twilight does as instructed, holding the ponytail in her magic. She lifts it behind Applejack's head.

"Oh, Hi Applejack, what are you doing here?"

Applejack facehoofs. "Now you believe me?"

"Believe what?"

Applejack sidesteps her floating ponytail. "I'm Applejack."

"You are not applejack."

Applejack steps back into her mane.

"Hi, Applejack."

"Twilight, do you have some tape?"

Applejack knocked on Rarity's front door, resisting the urge to scratch the back of her head.

"Hello, Applejack, how are you?" Rarity asks.

"Finally, somepony who recognizes me!"

Rarity lead Applejack over to the couch and the pair sat down. "What's going on, darling?"

"For some reason, nopony can recognize me without my ponytail."

"It is an iconic feature of yours."

"Thanks, I guess."

"But you have your ponytail, wherever would it go?"

Applejack accidentally scratched her head, causing her ponytail to fall off. "Well, there."

Rarity's eyes went wide. "They were right, you're not Applejack!"

"What do you mean, of course I am. Applebloom accidentally cut off my ponytail."

"That's exactly what an imposter would say."

"Rarity, I am Applejack."

"I can't believe you, whoever you are. To come into my house, pretending to be one of my best friends."

"What?"

"Get out of my establishment, go fool somepony else."

"Butâ€¦"

"Out!"

Applejack sighed, picking up her fallen mane, she walks out of Carousel Boutique.

Applejack knocked on Fluttershy's cottage door.

Fluttershy answered the door with a warm welcome. "Hello."

"Fluttershy, I need your help."

"With what? Who are you?"

Applejack gave Fluttershy her cut off ponytail. "Can you help me reattach my ponytail somehow? I'll tell you who I am if you help me."

"I guess I could try and help."

"Thank you, Fluttershy."

Fluttershy led Applejack into her home, where the two sat on her couch.

"I've never had to do something like this before, it might hurt a little."

"I can handle it."

It did in fact, hurt, but Applejack stuck through it as Fluttershy pulled and weaved her hair.

"There, done," Fluttershy said.

Applejack hugged Fluttershy, "Oh, thank you Fluttershy."

"Who are you, again?"

Applejack leaned back. "It's me, Applejack."

Fluttershy stared down Applejack, trying to decide if she believed her. "Maybe."

"What do you mean maybe? I am Applejack."

"Applejack's ponytail hangs down lower."

"That's because you had to reattach it."

"I'm sorry, but I don't believe you."

Applejack sighed. "Goodbye, Fluttershy."

"Goodbye, Applejack impersonator."

Applejack opened the door to Pinkie's bedroom. "Pinkie, are you here?"

Pinkie appeared in from of Applejack. "Yes, I am."

Applejack didn't react, and asked, "Who am I?"

Pinkie stared at Applejack, pondering who was in her room. "You're Applejack's twin sister!"

Applejack grunted. "I am Applejack!"

"Are you sure? You look a lot more like her twin sister I just met."

"Yes, I'm sure. i need help. Nopony recognizes me. I'm Applejack and nopony believes me."

"Why doesn't anypony recognize you?"

"Applebloom cut of my ponytail on accident."

"That's all it took for everypony to think you are somepony else?"

"Yes."
