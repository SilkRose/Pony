## Short Description:
During a speed-dating event, the mane six reveal the number of ponies they've cuddled… and maybe a bit more.

## Ideas:
- Each pony has a pony they want to be with, and some are bad at hiding it.
- Twilight has many questions about the cuddle count and how it's calculated.
- Fluttershy asks if animals count.
- Pinkie doesn't say a number, but says a lot, or it's implied to be literally everypony.
- Applejack's count is very small.
- Rarity asks about the pony she wants to be with a lot. (the one before her.)
- Rainbow wants to date Applejack but tries to play it cool.
- At the end, somepony points out that it's only the mane 6 at the speed dating event.
- Applejack points out the obvious parings at the end.
- Applejack is surprised everypony is taking this so seriously.
