# Cuddle Count

The buzzer rings, marking the start of the first speed date. Fluttershy sits down in front of me and introduces herself.

"Hello, my name is Fluttershy, and I love animals, and I run an animal sanctuary."

I go along with it. "Hello, my name is Applejack and I love apples and my family."

Fluttershy starts to blush. "I don't know if animals count, but I've cuddled five ponies."

"I don't see why that matters, who cares how many ponies you've cuddled?"

Fluttershy says, confused, "I don't know, the invite just said to count the number of ponies we've cuddled."

"Well, I don't think it matters, so let's move on."

"Okay."

"What sort of pony are you looking to date, Fluttershy?"

"Well, one that's very creative and inspiring. Somepony that can bring out beauty I have a hard time expressing."

I think for a second before saying my answer.

"I'm looking for a pony who learns quick and can take charge of a situation when needed. Somepony who will bring me down to earth like I'd do for them."

Before the conversation could continue, the buzzer rings, signalling the first partner switch.

***

Rarity sits down in front of me and immediately started talking.

"Did Fluttershy ask about me?"

I answer, "Not exactly."

"What does that mean?"

"Aren't we suppose to be on a date right now?"

"Oh, how rude of me. Sorry, Applejack. Hello, my name is Rarity, and I love fashion and I run several boutiques."

"Hello, you already know who I am and what I love."

"Well, I've cuddled fifteen ponies, how about you?"

"I still don't see why we need to bring that up."

"I did find it strange they said to bring it up, but I don't see the harm."

"If I was cuddling with Twilight, whose business is that but me and Twilight's?"

"Well, did you cuddle Twilight?"

"No, but it's none of your business."

"Is Twilight the pony you want to date?"

"Is Fluttershy the pony you want to date?"

"Maybe. What do you even want in a partner, Applejack?"

"Somepony's whose dependable, whose willing to help, and wants to learn."

"Sounds like Twilight, darling."

"What're you looking for, then?"

"I want somepony who is caring and kind. Somepony compassionate, patient, good at listening…"

_That could be any of us._

She continues, "… and beautiful."

"Fluttershy. Got it."

The bell rings again, and Rarity looked over at Twilight before whispering to me, "Good luck."

***

Twilight sits down and smiles.

"Hello, my name is Twilight Sparkle, and I love learning and reading."

"Howdy, Twilight. I'm Applejack, I love farming, apples, and family."

Twilight starts to blush. "I've cuddled six ponies."

I sigh. "I haven't cuddled a single pony, Twilight."

Twilight asks in shock, "Why haven't you?"

"I don't know, just been waiting for the right pony."

"Well, what sort of pony are you looking to date?"

Twilight leans in, awaiting my answer.

*Somepony who's smart, and pretty, and good at leading, somepony who likes reading and studying.*

*Somepony like Twilight!*

I stammer out, "Uh, somepony who… who is smart. And pretty."

Twilight is silent for a bit before she says, "Well, I'm also looking for somepony who's pretty. And smart."

*Who could that be? I'm not pretty or smart like Twilight is…*

The bell rings and Twilight moves onto the next table.

***

Pinkie sits down in front of me. "Hi, Applejack!"

"Hi, Pinkie. How's your dates been going?"

"They've been alright, I just don't know who I'm supposed to like."

"Well, what are you looking for?"

"I want somepony that likes fun as much as I do! And I want them to be able to fly as fast as I think. I want somepony who will always be there for me."

"You don't know who that is yet?"

"No. What are you looking for in a pony?"

I blush a little. "Somepony who's smart, and pretty, and good at leading, somepony who likes reading and studying."

"That reminds me of Twilight."

"Twilight said she wanted somepony pretty and smart, but that's not me…"

"Are you sure? Twilight's answer to me sure sounded a lot like you. And you are smart and pretty!"

"Well, thanks, but my speed-date with Twilight didn't go so well."

"Oh, I almost forgot, how many ponies have you cuddled?"

"None, you?"

Pinkie looks shocked before a blush takes over her face. "Just a few… million."

"Did you say a few million?"

"Yes, I've cuddled everypony in Equestria, except you!"

Before I have time to process her answer, the bell rings.

***

Rainbow sits down and says, "Sup."

"Not much, how's your dates going?"

"Could have gone better, how bout yours?"

"Same."

"So, how many ponies you cuddled?"

"None, you?"

"Wow, waiting for Twilight, I see."

"I never said anything about Twilight."

"Come on, Applejack, It's obvious, I saw how you and Twilight acted on your date."

"So what if I am? You didn't answer the question."

"Four, happy now?"

"You waiting on somepony too?"

"Maybe…"

"Well, what are you looking for?"

"Somepony that can keep up with me, that likes fun as much as I do. Somepony that's as good at pranking as me."

"Pinkie, you like Pinkie."

Rainbow blushes. "I never said that."

"It's okay, I think you got a shot."

"You do? — I mean, what do you like in Twilight, anyway?"

"She's really smart, a great leader, an amazing problem solver, darn pretty to boot."

"So, are you going to ask her out?"

"I don't know if she likes me."

"I think you got a shot."

The buzzer rings again, cutting off our conversation.

***

I blink as Fluttershy sits down in front of me again.

*Wait a second.*

Looking around, I see us six are the only ponies present.

I stand up and speak.

"Girls, why are we the only ones here?"

Nopony answers, so I continue. "Fluttershy and Rarity, just kiss already."

I point at Rainbow. "Rainbow and Pinkie, just kiss already."

I look at Twilight. "Twilight, will you go out with me?"
