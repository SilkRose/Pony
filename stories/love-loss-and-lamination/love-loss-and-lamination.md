# Love, Loss, and Lamination

I stand in front of a machine I know well. I've been here many times, used its features many times. But now, I was having trouble, now I couldn't do it.

*Come on, Twilight, you can do it.*

By the letter of Celestia, by the words of all my friends, by the vows of my wife, I was married.

With all that in mind, this should be easy, yet it wasn't. This should just be another task of documentation processing, but no, this was *lamination.*

I love Rainbow Dash, and she loves me. So, why was this so hard? Lamination was just a procedural step in the game of paperwork management. Yet, this time was different. This time it marked something I wasn't prepared for.

But what could it be? I've been standing here for over half an hour to just laminate this document. And I still haven't pinned down why.

I've been with Rainbow for many years now. We've gone thought so much together, countless memories of the good times and the bad. We've learned so much about each other and about friendship. Being with her has changed my life for the better.

Yet, I still can't do it. It can't be Rainbow Dash.

*What does laminating this marriage certificate change?*



As I'm about to finally press the start button, I hear somepony trotting towards me. I look and see Rainbow Dash.

Rainbow gets to me and asks, "Hey, Twilight, what are you doing?"

"Oh, just laminating our marriage certificate."

"Need any help?"

"Uh, sure. Just press the start button for me."

Rainbow presses the start button and the machine whirs to life.

She turns to me and wraps me in a loving embrace. "I love you."

I blush and wrap my hooves around her in turn. "I love you, too."

We kiss as the machine toils away in the background. All my worries and cares about a past life seem to vanish the second our lips meet.
