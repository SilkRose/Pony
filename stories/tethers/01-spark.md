# Spark

Nothing.

Emptiness.

Eternal black.

*Twinkle.*

And at that moment ![you](you-1.gif) were born.

In the briefest of glimpses, ![you](you-1.gif) see a purple unicorn, standing with a smile in the middle of her 5 friends as they face down a mare of pure night.

Just like it came into view, it vanished. ![you](you-1.gif) don't know how ![you](you-1.gif) knew what they were, or where ![you](you-1.gif) disappeared too. 

![you](you-1.gif) feel connected to them, like they are still so close and yet still so far away, like it would take 9 years to see them again, as if ![you](you-1.gif) knew exactly how long it would take.

![you](you-1.gif) look around in this new place, it feels connected to the place where ![you](you-1.gif) came from. ![you](you-1.gif) see lights moving, some move fast, some slow. So many colors, some brighter than others.

After ![you](you-1.gif) take a moment to get acquainted with your new surroundings, ![you](you-1.gif) notice ![you](you-1.gif) are moving the slowest out of any lights ![you](you-1.gif) see. Not in control of where ![you](you-1.gif) are going, ![you](you-1.gif) just move.

![you](you-1.gif) see a light moving to where ![you](you-1.gif) came from, this one a special one, it wasn't like the other ones, this one changed colors and was a lot brighter than most, sweeping through 6 distinct colors. It passes by ![you](you-1.gif), as ![you](you-1.gif) pass by it emanates thoughts.

*A blue pegasus filly performing a sonic rainboom to defend her friend and earns her cutie mark.*

*A yellow pegasus befriends some scared animals and earns her cutie mark.*

*A orange earth pony filly goes home where she belongs and gets her cutie mark.*

*A pink earth pony filly throws her family a party and earns her cutie mark.*

*A white unicorn discovered her affinity for finding gemstones and earns her cutie mark.*

*A purple unicorn casts uncontrolled magic and earns her cutie mark.*

As ![you](you-1.gif) absorb the last thought, ![you](you-1.gif) realize those ponies are the same as the ones who sparked ![you](you-1.gif) into existence, but a lot younger. ![you](you-1.gif) notice yourself emanating thoughts like it did.

*A purple unicorn mare happy to hear her friends.*

*A pink earth pony mare glad to see her friend is okay.*

*A white unicorn mare relieved her friend is unhurt.*

*A blue pegasus mare alleviated her friend is fine.*

*A yellow pegasus mare allayed her friend is safe.*

*A orange earth pony mare glad her friend is okay.*

After reliving your creation, ![you](you-1.gif) realize ![you](you-1.gif) are different from the rest, like the other one rotating the same 6 colors. After a moment, the light that passed ![you](you-1.gif) disappears. ![you](you-1.gif) feel a strong presence shift as the light fades from existence.

As ![you](you-1.gif) continue your eternal march forward, ![you](you-1.gif) look around for any more lights that might get close enough for ![you](you-1.gif) to hear them, to understand them and this place more.

As it would happen, there is a small green light about to pass ![you](you-1.gif), moving at a moderate pace, as it passes ![you](you-1.gif) absorb its thought.

*A green unicorn hugging her beige earth pony friend.*

*'Who are those ponies? Where is that orb going? What happens when it gets there?'* ![you](you-1.gif) think to yourself.
