# There

She was there. She had to be.

I laid in our bed, unwilling to open my eyes. It had been the same routine for weeks, an hour of pretending that if I kept my eyes closed long enough, that she would be there when I opened them. That she would still be… I bite back another sob, unable to handle another bout of tears.

I'm supposed to be the tough one, the cool pony who doesn't let anything affect her. Currently, though, I don't feel like Rainbow Dash anymore. I feel like a never-ending storm cloud. Cursed to ruin everything she touches. Enduring emotions I once blissfully never knew existed.

She was my everything, now… now she's this massive whole in my heart. I never thought I could live without her. Well, I wouldn't consider this living… I dare not move from my position in the bed, for it might upset the strings holding up my heart, or what's left of it.

I never thought anything like this would happen to us. We were invincible, we were heroes, we were in love. We had everything ahead of us, and nothing to be afraid of. At least that's what we thought…

How can this even happen? How can the world be so cruel? Why wasn't it me? The questions never stop, and never make it feel better. I know that there is nothing I can do to change the past, no matter how many times I beg to Twilight or Celestia.

Sometimes, I can almost feel her. Like she is still holding me, still whispering *I love you* in my ear. Like she is still there…

They said it would get better, but they didn't know the connection we had. It only got worse, the more time she's not there, the more pain I'm in. I got this same routine, this same pain every morning.

Getting up doesn't change anything, she's still gone, and I'm still alone. No, I'll stay in bed, keep my eyes closed, and pretend I'm still not broken. For another minute… another hour…

I consider getting up. I still know where everything is in our room. I haven't dared move anything since she left, how could I, how could I risk erasing even a smudge of her presence? I have trotted around enough with my eyes closed to know where everything was, perhaps if I could manifest the memory of her, of the way things had been when she was here, I could call her back from… I didn't want to think about where she had gone. *She will be there when I open my eyes, she will be there when I open them.* But she wasn't there, and I didn't open my eyes.

I've sat at her makeup desk and stared at myself in the mirror so many times, imagining all the ways she used to dress me up and do my makeup. I used to give her a hard time, but I loved it so much. How much I'd give to just do it once more with her. To do anything once more with her.



As I'm about to open my eyes and face the reality I knew was awaiting me, a hoof reached over me and held me tight.

"I love you, Rarity," I said as the tears started to fall.

"I love you too, Rainbow Dash."
