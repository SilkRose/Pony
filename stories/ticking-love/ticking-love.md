# Ticking Love

I materialize in Twilight's house, and sit down beside her.

*Thirty. She's so pretty!*

I ask, "Hey, Twilight, what are you up to?"

Twilight pushes her notes to the side. "Not much, just writing some notes. What are you doing, Pinkie?"

*Twenty-nine. Plotting our first kiss, hopefully.*

I smile. "Oh, I'm just checking in on my bestest friend."

Twilight continues writing her notes out of my view. "That's very nice of you, is there anything you needed?"

*Twenty-eight. A kiss would be nice.*

I say, sheepishly, "Maybe a hug or two."

Twilight gets up and hugs me tightly, three times. "Are you doing alright?"

I nuzzle her gently on the last hug.

*Twenty-seven. It would be better if I could tell you how I feel.*

"Yes, I just love getting hugs from my friends, especially *you*." My voice softening at the end.

"Oh, why me specifically, am I special?" Twilight's voice rising in pitch at the last part.

*Twenty-six. More than you know.*

I feel my face start to heat up. "You *might* mean a little more to me than the others…"

"What does that mean, Pinkie Pie?"

*Twenty-five. It means I love you.*

"Oh, I don't know."

"You know. What is it?"

*Twenty-four. I do, but it's hard to say.*

"It means I care about you a lot."

"More than the others, though?"

*Twenty-three. Yes.*

I blush. "Maybe…"

"Pinkie Pie, you are being very coy." Twilight giggles.

*Twenty-two. It's not time yet.*

"I'm just being me."

"You're good at that."

*Twenty-one. You're good at being cute.*

"What are you taking notes on?"

Twilight blushes and moves her notes farther from my view. "Stuff and things."

*Twenty. Where'd that blush come from?*

I say excitedly, "Oh, is it a secret? I can keep a secret!"

Twilight sighs. "I'm writing down how I feel about a certain pony."

*Nineteen. I hope it's me!*

"What kind of feelings?"

Twilight's blush intensifies. "Romantic feelings."

*Eighteen. I hope it's me!*

"Who is it? Do I know them?"

Twilight's voice becomes melancholic, "I can't say yet, and yes, very well."

*Seventeen. I need to know.*

"Is it one of our friends?"

"It is one of the ponies within our group of six friends, yes."

*Sixteen. It could be me!*

"Do you want to kiss them?"

"Yes," Twilight says, blushing harder.

*Fifteen. She looks so pretty when she blushes.*

"Do you think they like you back?"

"I don't know, but I might have an idea."

*Fourteen. I have a few ideas… that involve kissing you.*

"What's your idea?"

"I can't say yet, just don't read my notes until I'm finished with them," Twilight says before she starts writing again.

*Thirteen. She's going to share with me.*

I nod. "Okay!"

"Thank you."

*Twelve. So polite.*

"Can I ask more questions while you write?"

"Sure."

*Eleven. I have many questions, dear Twilight.*

"Do you know if they like mares?"

"I think they do."

*Ten. I do… specifically you.*

"What if they don't like you?"

"I think they do, but if they don't well have to talk about it."

*Nine. I like you.*

"What if somepony else likes you?"

"I'm pretty sure we like each other, just need to get it out there."

*Eight. It's me. Right?*

"How can you confirm this?"

"I am in the middle of writing my love down…"

*Seven. Should I have written a love letter?*

"Can I read it, pretty please?"

"When I'm done."

*Six. I hope it's soon…*

"Can I ask who it is?"

"Sure, you can guess."

*Five. Let's see who it is!*

"Is it Fluttershy?"

"No."

*Four. Yay!*

"Is it Applejack?"

"No."

*Three. Ah, yeah!*

"Is it Rainbow Dash?"

"No."

*Two. Awesome!*

"Is it Rarity?"

"No."

*One. It has to be me, darling!*

"Is it me?"

Twilight finishes writer her note and gives it to me.

I read it aloud.

> Dear Pinkie,
>
> I've thought of many ways to tell you this, and still settled on a love letter. I like you, a lot. I've never felt this way about another pony. Oh, you just showed up, and now I'm pretending to write something inconspicuous. You ask a lot of questions, it's one of the things I love about you. So curious, always wondering. Oh, did I just say I love you? Well, I do. I love you.
>
> You're acting different, differently than normal. Are you hiding something? You have been acting strange around me. I guess I've been acting strange too. I apologize for that, I just don't know what these feelings mean. Maybe you could help me figure it out?
>
> And Pinkie, if the last two paragraphs didn't make it clear enough, it's you. Will you go out with me?
>
> Love,
> Twilight.
>
> P.S. a kiss would be nice.

My eyes are full of joyous tears as I set the note down.

*Zero. A kiss, you shall get, Twilight!*

I wrap my hooves around her and kiss her passionately.

She kisses back as we enjoy the moment, happy tears flowing from her eyes.

"I love you."

"I love you too."

I kiss her again and we both blush.
