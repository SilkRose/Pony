# Ticking Love

*Thirty.*

"Hey, Twilight, what are you up to?"

"Not much, just writing some notes. What are you doing, Pinkie?"

*Twenty-nine. Plotting our first kiss.*

"Oh, I'm just checking in on my bestest friend."

"That's very nice of you, is there anything you needed?"

*Twenty-eight. A kiss would be nice.*

"Maybe a hug or two."

Twilight gets up and hugs me tightly. "Are you doing alright?"

*Twenty-seven. It would be better if I could tell you how I feel.*

"Yes, I just love getting hugs from my friends, especially *you*."

"Oh, why me specifically, am I special?"

*Twenty-six. More than you know.*

"You *might* mean a little more to me than the others…"

"What does that mean, Pinkie Pie?"

*Twenty-five. It means I love you.*

"Oh, I don't know."

"You know, what is it?"

*Twenty-four.*

"It means I care about you a lot."

"More than the others, though?"

*Twenty-three. Yes.*

"Maybe…"

"Pinkie Pie, you are being very coy."

*Twenty-two. It's not time yet.*

"I'm just being me."

"You're good at that."

*Twenty-one.*

"What are you taking notes on?"

Twilight blushes. "Stuff and things."

*Twenty.*

"Oh, is it a secret? I can keep a secret!"

Twilight sighs. "I'm writing down how I feel about a certain pony."

*Nineteen.*

"Which pony?"

"I can't tell you, not yet at least."

*Eighteen.*

"Do I know them?"

"Hmm, yes, very well."

*Seventeen.*

"Is it one of our friends?"

"It is one of the ponies within our group of six friends, yes."

*Sixteen.*

"Do you like them romantically?"

"Yes," Twilight says, blushing harder.

*Fifteen.*

"Do you think they like you back?"

"I don't know, but I might have an idea."

*Fourteen.*

"What's your idea?"

"I can't say yet, just don't read my notes until I'm finished with them," Twilight says before she starts writing again.

*Thirteen.*

"Okay!"

"Thank you."

*Twelve.*

"Can I ask more questions while you write?"

"Sure."

*Eleven.*

"Do you know if they like mares?"

"I think they do."

*Ten.*

"What if they don't like you?"

"I think they do."

*Nine.*

"What if somepony else likes you?"

"I think the one who likes me is the one I like."

*Eight.*

"How can you confirm this?"

"I am in the middle of writing my love down…"

*Seven.*

"Can I read it?"

"Not yet."

*Six.*

"Can I ask who it is?"

"Sure, you can guess."

*Five.*

"Is it Fluttershy?"

"No."

*Four.*

"Is it Applejack?"

"No."

*Three.*

"Is it Rainbow Dash?"

"No."

*Two.*

"Is it Rarity?"

"No."

*One.*

"Is it me?"

"Yes," Twilight gives me her note.

I read it to myself.

*Zero.*

I wrap my hooves around her and kiss her passionately.

She kisses back as we enjoy the moment.

"I love you."

"I love you too."

I kiss her again and we both blush.
