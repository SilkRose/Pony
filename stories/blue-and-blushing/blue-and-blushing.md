# Blue and Blushing

I look up at the title and see it tick down another minute. I knock on Rarity's door again, this time harder.

Come on, Rarity, we don't have all day.

Rarity answers the door almost immediately after. She looked worse for ware, her mane has stray hairs and a hairbrush hanging from it. Her makeup was half-running down her face. Her coat looks like it could use a good brushing.

She probably doesn't think it, but even now, in this state, she is the most beautiful mare I've seen.

"Hello, Rainbow Dash, what brings you here? Anything I can do for you?"

I can hear it in her voice, she's been crying. I give her my best, most confident smile. "I'm here for you."

Rarity looks at me confused, expecting further explanation, which I don't give her. I put my hoof around her and lead her into her home, closing the door behind us.

I take her over to one of her pedestals, and point for her to get up. She does so, but still looking confused.

I pick up some tissues from a box on the floor and use them to clean Rarity's face of makeup. As I finish, she sniffles with the barest hint of a smile on her face.

Taking the hairbrush from her mane in my mouth, I start to brush her mane. I brush gently as I make sure to get each stray hair.

As I brush, I can see the smile on her face grow, still mixed with confusion. I get down to the lower part of her mane and swipe a quick nuzzle on her chest in between one of the brushes.

She's so soft.

I finish brushing her mane and look at her with a smile. She looks back with a smile and the barest hint of a blush.

I move behind her and start brushing her tail. I look up between sweeps and see she is still looking forward.

She looks so pretty from every angle. I try not to stare at her too much, and focus on my pampering.

After finishing her tail, I slyly rub up against her side as get up onto the pedestal with her. I nuzzle her cheek for the briefest of moments before walking around her front to her other side.

I start to brush her coat as I notice the blush that has formed on my face. I look up at Rarity between swipes of the brush.

Her ears are folded back. I hope that's a good sign.

Is that a blush on her face?

I continue brushing, moving to her cutie mark. I take extra care, going slowly over them.

My efforts are rewarded when I hear an adorable muffled giggle come from Rarity. I steal a quick nuzzle on her cutie mark before continuing down to brush her legs.

Whether this is our last day together or not, you deserve to feel as beautiful as I know you are.

I finish brushing that leg and move onto the next. I wonder what she is thinking about. I know she's all I've been able to think about for a few hours now.

I hope she feels the same way about me. Otherwise, I'm going to feel like an idiot.

I guess feeling like an idiot isn't so bad if it makes Rarity feel better. She clearly needed help.

I move onto her third leg as I look into her eyes for a moment.

Her eyes are so beautiful, they remind me of a clear open sky full of potential. I love staring into them. I love her.

I continue to brush as I think about our friendship.

She might be the only pony I'd admit this to, but I sometimes do like girly things. I would never tell anypony else, but telling her might be worth it to hear that adorable squeal.

I never thought I'd have fallen for one of my friends, but she feels different. She wants to bring out the beauty in ponies, and maybe I want to see mine.

I definitely don't mind seeing her beauty, I hope she sees it when I'm done.

I move to her last leg, still lost in thought.

I know I love her, but the real question is: does she love me?

I know we've both been acting weird around each other, but what if she's just acting that way because I am?

Usually Rarity would call out weird behavior, but she hasn't this time. Makes me think that she might feel the same way about me.

I hope she does.

Once I'm done with her leg, I place a hoof on her cutie mark and use it to motion for her to sit. She does so, and I move in front of her.

I start to brush her chest as an idea comes to my mind. After brushing the main part of her chest, I flip the brush around and nuzzle her chest, while pretending to brush a specific spot on her coat over and over.

As I do, I listen to her heartbeat. Its rhythmic beating at an accelerated rate, endearing and soothing.

I get lost in the moment and forgot to keep brushing. I just stand there, holding my head to her chest.

Rarity takes notice, and wraps her hooves around me, holding me gently before nuzzling the top of my head.

As I take in the moment I swear I could feel Rarity kiss the top of my head. I decide to return the favor, and kiss her leg in front of me.

Rarity let's go a moment later, and I try to hide my blush by immediately starting to brush the fur on her stomach.

I brush more gently than even on her cutie mark. I can already hear stifled giggles.

Rarity, I hope you know how cute you are, because if you don't, I will have to inform you.



As the lights dim around us and the melodies start, I can feel the song coming on.

"Oh, Rarity," – I point at her – "why are you so blue?"  
"Don't you know," – I hold her close as I sit beside her – "I'm here for you"  
"To pamper you," – I brush her chest with the brush – "yes, it's true"  
"Need to see your smile." I hold my hooves under her chin.  
"Make it last a while." I lift her chin, getting dangerously close to kissing her.

Rarity takes over singing for the next verse.

"Oh, Rainbow," – She points at me – "it's true, you are my crush."  
"You showed me love," – She holds her head to my chest – "you took my brush."  
"Gave me attention," – She nuzzles my cheek – "you made me blush."  
"You put me in a state of bliss." She holds my chin with her hooves.  
"Its you, who I want to kiss." She lifts my chin, bringing our lips together, kissing.

We sing the last verse in unison.

"Oh, (Rarity | Rainbow)," – We point at each other – "here to give my love, never ending"  
"Always be here for you," – We hug – "best friends, always trending"  
"My heart needed you," – We hold each other's hoof to our chest – "wanted mending"  
"Need to hold your hoof, every way." We hold hooves and blush.  
"Need to make you blush, every day." We finish the song with a tight, loving embrace.



I put my right hind leg in between Rarity's back legs, pressing against her left hind leg. I swish my tail and wrap it around her tail. Leaning my body down, I lay over top Rarity's back, wrapping my left foreleg around her neck, while resting my right on the floor.

I pull us close together as we stare together in the mirror. We hold the pose as both of us smile wide, genuine smiles at our reflection. Neither of us caring about the massive blushes on our faces.

I can't hold my feelings back anymore, I take the opportunity of our closeness and plant a gentle kiss right onto the blush on Rarity's cheek.
