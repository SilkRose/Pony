## Short Description:
Applejack has a secret admirer, and Rarity is determined to make her figure out who it is.

## Ideas:
- She has 5 love letters and each is imitating a mane 6 members, but each has a slight hint at Rarity. And they go and interview each of them.
- Their friends are in on it, like Rarity helped them each write a love letter to AJ and know that it's Rarity.
- At the start, they read all five letters, then go one pony at a time and interview them. But before each interview, Rare asks AJ how she would feel if it were said pony.
- She only gets four letters at the start, missing one that is like from Rarity.
- But, after they go through all 4 ponies, Rarity asks, what if it were her? Applejack is confused and gets angry she hasn't figured it out yet.
- Applejack goes home and finds the last love letter, the one like Rarity.
- Applejack figures it out and goes back to Rarity.

## Cover Idea:
