# Applejack's Admirer

We all know it's me. I know it, our friends know it, but most importantly, you _don't_ know it. At least, not yet anyway.

I look at Applejack with whimsy in my eyes.

*She's got to figure it out herself.*

"Rarity?" Applejack says.

*Such a beautiful mare.*

"Rarity, will you stop staring at me an' figure out who's writing these love notes?"

"Oh, yes, certainly Applejack."

"What's our first step?"

*For you: stop looking so cute.*

"Let's review the notes, could I have the first one?"

"Here it is, to me, it sounds like Fluttershy wrote it."

Applejack gives me the first note, I remember it well.

I scan the note, pretending to read it.

> Dear Applejack,
>
> Too shy to speak my heart, I watch you from afar.
>
> My feelings for you are louder than I'll ever be.
>
> Until today, they were only for me and my heart to hear alone.
>
> Love,
> Applejack's Admirer

> Dear Applejack,

> Dear Applejack,
>
> Have to admit, I am weak for you, dear.
>
> Wish I had the courage to tell to your face, how much I am inspired by your perseverance, strength, and integrity.
>
> Before I met you, I thought that only gemstones shine bright when there's lightâ€¦ Thank you. You opened my eyes to what is truly important.

> Love,
> Applejack's Admirer
