# Applejack's Admirer

We all know it's me. I know it, our friends know it, but most importantly, she _doesn't_ know it. At least, not yet, anyway.

I look at Applejack with whimsy in my eyes.

*She's got to figure it out herself.*

"Rarity?" Applejack says.

*Such a beautiful mare.*

"Rarity, will you stop staring at me an' figure out who's writing these love notes?"

"Oh, yes, certainly Applejack."

"What's our first step?"

*For you: stop looking so cute.*

"Let's review the first note. Could I take a look?"

"Here ya go, seems like Fluttershy wrote it."

Applejack gives me the first note, I remember it well.

I scan the note, pretending to read it.

> Dear Applejack,
>
> Too shy to speak my heart, I watch you from afar.
>
> My feelings for you are louder than I'll ever be.
>
> Until today, they were only for me and my heart to hear alone.
>
> Love,
> Applejack's Admirer

"Yes, this definitely sounds like Fluttershy. Would you like me to ask her?"

Applejack sheepishly rubs the back of her neck. "I mean, that'd be nice. But the thing is, I got a whole bunch of notes, and each of them seems to be from one of our friends!"

"Is that so? Well then, how about we go over them one at a time and speak with each pony you think wrote each one, starting with this one?"

Applejack nods. "Alright then, sounds like a plan to me."

"Okay, darling, follow me," I say as I lead Applejack out of my home.

We trot side by side in silence for a while as I admire her and think.

*She looks so determined, in a charming way.*

She stares straight ahead, as I look at her freckles.

*So adorable.*

Her mane dances back and forth in the wind as it peeks out from underneath her hat.

*Such a lovely mane, and surprisingly well kempt.*

Applejack notices me, and asks, "You're starin' pretty, what's on your mind?"

"Let me ask this; if it were Fluttershy, how would that make you feel?"

"I reckon I don't fully know. I have thought about it, heck, I thought about if it were each of them, including you. But, if it were Fluttershy, I would give her a chance. I suspect she would bring a calmness to my life."

I crack a smile. "You really think so?"

Applejack nods. "She keeps a level head, and I suppose that might help on some of my more stubborn days."

"She would, wouldn't she?" I bite my lip in silence.

*I guess I didn't realize how much I'd be learning about what she considers in a partner.*

"Fluttershy definitely seems like the type to write a note, with her being all shy, but if it is her, where did the other notes come from?"

"I don't know, darling, but, I'll make sure we figure it out together."

Applejack smiles at me. "Thank you."

"Thank *you*, for coming to me with this. I'm glad to help."

Applejack just nods as we trot the rest of the trip in silence.

We trot to Fluttershy's front door, and as I'm about to know, Applejack stops me.

"Uh, Rarity? You sure it wouldn't be better if I just stay outside while you do the whole interview thing?"

"Don't you want to be there when we find out?"

"I dunno, Rarity, it doesn't feel right to just listen in on a friend's thoughts on me."

"Oh nonsense, you should be there. I want to see your reaction to whom it is, anyway."

"Well, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't curious who's behind all this. Alright, let's do this."

I knock on Fluttershy's door, and we wait for her to answer.

Fluttershy answers her door with a smile. "Hello, Applejack, Rarity, would you like to come in?"

I speak up. "Yes, darling, we had a few questions for you, if that's alright?"

"Certainly, right this way," Fluttershy says before leading us into her house.

Applejack and I take a seat on her couch, while Fluttershy sits in a chair across from us.

Fluttershy asks, "What did you need to ask?"

I levitate the note to her. "Did you write this note?"

Fluttershy reads the note before shaking her head. "It looks like something I might write, but it wasn't me."

I ask a followup, "What were you doing three days ago in the morning time?"

"I was feeding my chickens, like I do every Monday."

I ask the last question, "Pardon the intrusion, but, if you *did* like Applejack, what would be her most attractive quality to you?"

Applejack looks at me with a raised brow, clearly not amused.

Fluttershy plays the part perfectly, pretending to be taken aback. A few moments later, she turns to Applejack and says, "You're the most dependable pony I know, whenever I'm in need, I go to you."

Applejack tips her hat. "Thank you kindly, Fluttershy."

Fluttershy replies, "You're welcome."

I explain, "We are trying to find who wrote these notes, since it wasn't you, we will head to the next pony."

"Oh, okay, good luck."

"Thank you, darling, we will be on our way."

We say our goodbyes before leaving, Fluttershy closing the door for us.

Applejack takes the opportunity to question me, raising her voice, ever so slightly. "What was that last question all about?"

*I knew that was coming.*

"I just want to have some clues to go off in case all of them say it wasn't them."

Applejack says, a bit more apologetically, "Oh, I guess that's alright."

I ask, "Could I see the next note, and who do you think it's from?"

Applejack gives me the next note, saying, "I think this one is from Rainbow, she does like to sleep in my trees an awful lot."

I scan the note.

> Dear Applejack,
>
> In any competition, I'll beat you into the mud, but in this one, you've won.
>
> Not good with this lovey-dovey stuff.
>
> ~~I like watching you from the apple trees.~~
>
> Love,
> Applejack's Admirer

"I agree, feels like Rainbow Dash."

"We're goin' to talk to her now?"

"Yes, darling."

"I'm pretty sure I saw her sleeping in a tree on the farm when I was coming over, I'll lead the way."

I nod and follow her.

Applejack continues, "The farm is close by, so shouldn't take long to get to her."

"Indeed."

After a moment of silence, I turn to her, "How would you feel if it was Rainbow Dash?"

"I think she's in the top two most likely. If it were her, I'd tease her to all end about this whole mess, but I'd still say yes. She'd make the day to day more exciting, I bet."

"How so?"

"She'd probably spend a lot more time around here on the farm. I reckon she'd turn a lot of the lovey-dovey stuff into some sort of competition, as a way to cover up how much she likes it, and so she could win."

*I need to remember these for later.*

"Would you let her win?"

*Would you let me win?*

"I might do it a few times, but I'd do my best to beat her."

I surprise myself by asking, "Do you want it to be her?"

*Why did I ask that?*

Applejack is taken back, taking a moment before saying, "It's not my choice who likes me, so thinking on it is pointless, least in my eyes."

"Makes sense," I say sheepishly before we walk the rest of the way in silence.

Stopping at the tree Rainbow is sleeping in, we hear her snoring loudly.

*Glad to see she's in character,* I think to myself before stifling a laugh.

Applejack smiles, "I'll wake her." She trots to the tree and gives it a buck, shaking the tree.

Rainbow wakes up in a daze. "Who's there…" Rubbing her eyes, she looks down at use. "Hi," she says before gliding down and landing in front of us.

I say, "Rainbow, we need to ask you a few questions."

Rainbow smiles. "Okay, shoot."

I levitate the note in front of her and ask, "Did you write this?"

Rainbow scoffs at the note. "This is a prank, right? I would never write that."

I shake my head. "No, this is not a prank."

"If I liked somepony, they would be the one writing me love notes."

Applejack facehoofs before I ask the next question. 

"What were you doing on the morning of two days ago?"

Rainbow looks confused. "I don't know, probably sleeping."

"I see."

"Any more questions? I still need to finish my nap."

"Last one, What quality of Applejack's would be most appealing if you *did* like her romantically?"

Rainbow thinks for a second before turning to Applejack with a smile. "You're the most determined pony I know, you never give up, no matter how big the problem is."

Applejack says, "Thank you kindly."

Rainbow yawns. "Back to bed for me, good luck with whatever this is."

"Thank you," I say before we say our goodbyes.

Rainbow flies back into her tree and falls asleep immediately.

I start trotting into town, and Applejack follows.

She asks, "What do we do if the other two deny it?"

"We'll cross that bridge if we get to it. I'll make sure we solve this case."

"Well, the next note sounds like Twilight, you wanna see it?"

"Absolutely, darling."

She gives me the third note and I once again scan it.

> Dear Applejack,
>
> My feelings for you are like a worm in an apple of my heart, eating me up inside.
>
> Did you know that apples are one hundred percent nutrition and fun?
>
> With you, I would never need to visit a doctor, ever again. ~~I would, but you get the sentiment, right?~~
>
> Love,

> Dear Applejack,
>
> They say apples are sweet, and I can't deny:
>
> That means that you are like a dessert to my eye!
>
> You're my sugarcrush! Wanna feed you some pie.
>
> Love,
> Applejack's Admirer


> Dear Applejack,
>
> Have to admit, I am weak for you, dear.
>
> Wish I had the courage to tell to your face, how much I am inspired by your perseverance, strength, and integrity.
>
> Before I met you, I thought that only gemstones shine bright when there's light… Thank you. You opened my eyes to what is truly important.

> Love,
