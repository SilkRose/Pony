# Applejack's Admirer

*We all know it's me, I know it, you know it, but most importantly, Applejack* doesn't *know it.*

I look at Applejack with whimsy in my eyes.

*She's got to figure it out herself.*

"Rarity?" Applejack says.

*Such a beautiful mare.*

"Rarity, will you stop staring at me an' figure out who's writing these love notes?"

"Oh, yes, certainly Applejack."

"What's our first step?"

*For you: stop looking so cute.*

"Let's review the notes, could I have the first one?"

"Here it is, to me, it sounds like Fluttershy wrote it."

Applejack gives me the first note, I remember it well.

I scan the note, pretending to read it.

> Dear Applejack,

> Too shy to speak my heart, I watch you from afar.
>
> My feelings for you are louder than I'll ever be.
