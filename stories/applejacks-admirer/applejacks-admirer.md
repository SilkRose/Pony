# Applejack's Admirer

We all know it's me. I know it, our friends know it, but most importantly, she _doesn't_ know it. At least, not yet, anyway.

I look at Applejack with whimsy in my eyes.

*She's got to figure it out herself.*

"Rarity?" Applejack says.

*Such a beautiful mare.*

"Rarity, will you stop staring at me an' figure out who's writing these love notes?"

"Oh, yes, certainly Applejack."

"What's our first step?"

*For you: stop looking so cute.*

"Let's review the first note. Could I take a look?"

"Here ya go, seems like Fluttershy wrote it."

Applejack gives me the first note, I remember it well.

I scan the note, pretending to read it.

> Dear Applejack,
>
> Too shy to speak my heart, I watch you from afar.
>
> My feelings for you are louder than I'll ever be.
>
> Until today, they were only for me and my heart to hear alone.
>
> Love,

"Yes, this definitely sounds like Fluttershy. Would you like me to ask her?"

Applejack sheepishly rubs the back of her neck. "I mean, that'd be nice. But the thing is, I got a whole bunch of notes, and each of them seems to be from each of our other friends!"

"Is that so? Well then, how about we go over them one at a time and speak with each pony you think wrote each one, starting with this one?"

Applejack nods. "Alright then, sounds like a plan to me."

"Okay, darling, follow me," I say as I lead Applejack out of my home.

We trot side by side in silence for a while before I question her.

"Let me ask this, if it were Fluttershy, how would that make you feel?"
