# Musical Musings of the Heart

Vinyl Scratch, self proclaimed best DJ in Equestria, was trotting down the streets of Canterlot with a big grin. She was wearing her iconic purple sunglasses and headphones, blasting dubtrot music. Her destination for today was this music shop down La Hay street. It was awesome! And the stallion that ran the joint, Psytrance, was dope, willing to vibe with anything. Yesterday, he sent her mail saying he just acquired the newest album of (insert name here), Vinyl bought train tickets immediately.

_Jingle_.

“Yoooo!” Vinyl announced with a pep in her step as she allowed the door close behind her, but instead of hearing the little bell jingle again, the door opened. 

“Hello, Mr. Psytra…oh, my apologies.” Vinyl turned around, confused and interested. Anypony who liked this relateively unknown store was cool in her book. It was a gray earth pony mare, styled and smooth dark mane, and a clean pink bowtie. 

Octavia Melody, famous cellist and known for her beautiful classical compositions, trotted into a store because the owner, Psytrance, had sent her an envelope which contained an invitation to come see the newest album of (insert name here). In her haste, she did not notice the pony who was standing in front of the door.

“...oh my apologies.” The pony turned around and Octavia took note of the messy electric blue mane, the garish purple sunglasses, unkept white coat. Not to mention, the loud dubtrot coming from her headphones. 

_Jingle_.

“Vinyl! Octavia!” Pystrance came around the corner, wearing a warm smile. “You’re finally here, took you long enough. Haha!” 

The two mares were surprised about each others presences that they didn’t react when the purple stallion put his hooves around both of their necks and basically dragged them both to the vinyl record section.
